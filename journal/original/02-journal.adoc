== Memoir

+++[+++As the traveller in a desert rejoices to find the way-marks of former pilgrims,
and is strengthened and encouraged when he can trace
the footsteps of those who have gone before him,
so may the pilgrims of Canaan,
the travellers to a "`better country,`" delight to trace the
pathway by which their brethren and sisters have been led,
through this land of shadows, to their heavenly and eternal rest.
It is with this view that the following imperfect
account of a beloved sister is presented to the public,
not in any way to exalt the creature--as though in her, as of herself,
there dwelt or could dwell,
any good thing--but to exalt and to magnify the power of that
Saviour who led his trusting follower safely along.
May those near and dear to the beloved departed,
for whose advancement in the way everlasting her spirit was so
frequently and so fervently bowed before the footstool of mercy,
be engaged to seek, with increasing earnestness,
a preparation for that heavenly country which is now,
we reverently and confidently believe, her "`happy home.`"
May some of her brethren and sisters in religious profession,
have their faith a little confirmed in the truth of those principles,
which she with them professed, and which were dear to her to the last,
and may Christians of every name, recognize,
in this cross-bearing and crown-wearing follower of the Lamb,
another added to the cloud of witnesses,
to the truth and faithfulness of our God--the love and mercy of our Saviour.

It is believed that the perusal of this memoir,
may tend to the encouragement of those whose faces are set Zionwards,
and yet whose hands are often ready to hang down--that
instruction may be reaped by these from the experience of her
whose short life is sketched in the following pages.
They may mark how she was led, step by step, through the wilderness of this world,
permitted to have trials and to experience deep provings, but enabled,
from season to season, to rejoice in them all; brought more than once,
in all human appearance, to the very borders of the grave,
and again raised up to testify of the goodness of her Lord and Master;
supported in the near prospect of death,
and finally upheld amidst the swellings of Jordan,
and enabled rejoicingly to look forwards, to the land of perfect rest and peace,
where temptation cannot approach, and the billows of affliction roll no more.

Mary Ann Gilpin, the subject of the following memoir, was born in Bristol,
in the 6th month, 1813.
Few particulars of her very early days seem worthy of record:
her disposition was very affectionate, but there needed not, even in her earliest years,
abundant proof that she was indeed by nature a child of wrath, even as others; and truly,
in tracing a memorial of her time on earth, we must speak of her as a sinner,
by grace redeemed.
When between ten and eleven years of age,
she spent a considerable time with her sister J+++______+++,
under the kind care of an aunt at N+++______+++, and it appears to have been while there,
that she received the first abiding serious impressions,
so that she ever looked back to this time with real satisfaction,
and to this beloved relative,
as to one who was instrumental in bringing her to the knowledge of her Saviour.
She does not, however,
appear to have fully yielded to the convictions with
which she was at this time mercifully favoured,
for in after years she speaks of the time spent at a school in Cornwall,
under the watchful care of some friends,
as being the season of renewed visitation under which
she was first brought to feel herself a sinner,
and with this conviction to turn with her whole heart unto the Saviour of sinners,
and to look upon Him whom she could acknowledge even her sins had pierced.

She heard the voice of the good Shepherd, and, sincerely desiring to obey it,
was enabled to distinguish it from the voice of the stranger,
and brought to love Him who had first loved her.

When at home, she very early exercised a watchful care over her brothers and sisters,
and in simplicity endeavoured to bring them to walk in wisdom`'s paths.
She had a way peculiarly her own to convey to the different members of her
family the counsel or admonition she thought it right to give them.
Often has she checked the rising evil tempers of her younger brothers,
when striving together, by the gentle repetition of some such lines as these: Remember--

[verse]
____
"`He that condescends the most,
Remains the victor still.`"
____

And when those about her own age had, in her view, yielded to temptation,
or given way to angry feeling,
or suffered the ever-watchful adversary to gain the mastery,
a little note laid on the dressing-table would convey a sister`'s faithful warning.
It would be easy to record many traits of character
which displayed themselves during this part of her life,
and are fondly treasured up in the hearts of her surviving friends--
but these are more fully exemplified in her after years,
and shown too in the language of her own heart, as recorded by her own pen;
and as it is our object to let the beloved departed speak, as far as possible,
for herself,
the account of her life up to the time concerning which there
remain written memorials of her spiritual experience,
and the love-fraught dealings of the Good Shepherd towards her,
will be as short as seems consistent with the desire,
to present a connected narrative of her earthly course.

In the year 1829, a severe attack of inflammation prostrated her bodily strength,
for a while threatened her life, and caused much acute suffering.
During this time, when the pains of the body were so great,
she gave sweet evidence of having experienced the new birth,
by her patient endurance of suffering,
and uncomplaining and cheerful submission to
whatever might be the divine will concerning her.
The means employed to subdue this disease reduced her so low, that she thought herself,
and was thought by several around her, to be dying.
At this time her lips moving, her dear mother leaned over her and caught the words,

[verse]
____
"`The pangs of death are o`'er me,
I see the jasper wall,
Jesus has pass`'d before me,
And God the Judge of all.`"
____

She was raised from this bed of sickness increasingly qualified to
tell of the faithfulness of Him in whom she believed,
and in leaning on whose arm of everlasting love she had been supported,
when it appeared to herself that the pitcher was well nigh
marred at the fountain--the wheel broken at the cistern.

It seems to have been her practice from the year 1829,
to keep a daily record of the events of her life,
and the dealings of her heavenly Father;
and in making selections from the mass of interesting and instructive matter,
the object aimed at has been, while avoiding unnecessary repetition,
to bring into view the principles which governed her life and conduct,
those to which in the silent hour of solemn commune
with her own heart she makes such constant reference,
and which brought her to desire with increasing earnestness,
a full conformity to the will of Him, whose will concerning his followers,
is even their perfection.

The following are extracts from the early part of her diary,
several of which allude to the illness referred to:]

[.asterism]
'''

1829, 8mo. 7th.--How does the time pass on, yet how regardless do we, many of us,
seem of its rapid progress, as if this were to be our place of rest,
but here how often we are reminded that "`we have no
continuing city;`" then how anxious we ought to be,
to seek that city which hath foundations, "`whose maker and builder is God.`"

8th.--This day I have indeed been afresh reminded of the uncertainty of everything here,
for I have been brought very near death, so near,
that I thought there was no probability of my living through the day,
yet I was not forsaken,
but was enabled in my hours of greatest suffering to look unto Him, who,
though I had not seen, I felt that I loved,
and the separation from all my earthly friends,
appeared as nothing when compared to the happiness I felt in
the thought of being forever with my beloved Saviour,
who supported me through this day of suffering, and who will, I doubt not,
be ever willing to come to the assistance of any of us,
if we do but ask Him with sincerity.
Oh, He is indeed able to save to the uttermost all those who come unto Him.

9th.--Better this morning, though still very ill.
I am however very comfortable, and do not feel at all anxious about myself.
I trust this does not arise from a state of indifference, but I earnestly desire,
that whatever my heavenly Father sees fit for me, whether I live or die,
that I shall not murmur,
though the prospect of a return to health at times feels very trying--I am so
afraid that the cares of this world will again engage my thoughts too much,
and that I shall not seek sufficiently what ought to appear of most value to us.

12th.--Thought much of my dear aunt P+++______+++ and her
kind instructions when I was a very little girl,
I fear they were not long of much benefit to me, for when I returned home from N+++______+++,
where I had been staying some time with her,
I neglected to attend to what she had kindly told me was right,
and my heart was far from being in the state in
which it ought to have been for a long time;
but oh,
I trust I am again feeling more concerned about the things which belong unto my peace,
and that all I have passed through will not prove useless.

21st.--Many of my friends, I fear, think too highly of me, but they cannot know me well;
oh,
I do trust that He who alone knows the heart will make me
truly humble--will make me to see myself as I really am.

25th.--I have had a most sweet visit from +++_______+++,
one which I trust I shall long remember for my instruction.
She told me she had thought that I was near obtaining the crown,
but now she believed I had yet more of the cross to bear;
she hoped I might prove a blessing to others,
and reminded me of the great Physician to whom I could apply.
She ended with repeating those lines:

[verse]
____
"`May`'st thou learn to know and fear Him,
Serve and love Him all thy days,
Then go live forever near Him,
See His face and sing His praise.`"
____

Oh, may this indeed be the case.
Amidst the many temptations which surround me on every side,
may my strength be in the Lord my God.
Oh, we are assured--and may we not believe--that He is able
to save to the uttermost all who come unto Him,
even little children; then whatever happens I may as a little child come unto Christ,
and oh, in all my difficulties, however great they may be, I trust I shall find relief.
Yes, I fully believe that He is a shelter from every storm.

28th.--What truly kind friends I possess; surely it is cause for thankfulness,
for I feel I little deserve them,
I hope I shall never forget the extreme kindness
of my parents and friends during my last illness.

9mo. 15th.--Very comfortable;
yet as I get stronger I feel more and more the
danger of a return to the active duties of life,
as being so liable to engage my thoughts too much.
If it had been consistent with the divine will, oh how willing,
how glad should I have been to be taken,
to be forever with my Saviour--yet it was no doubt for some wise,
though to us hidden purpose, that I was raised up, and I trust I shall not complain;
with the thoughts of dying,
how much happier were my feelings than they are now with the thoughts of living;
but oh I ought to be, and I trust I am, willing to do either;
and even now I have felt doubts this afternoon
about my ever being quite well and strong again,
and should I again be laid on a bed of sickness, oh,
may the same feelings be mine which I have lately enjoyed,
they are worth more than any thing this world can give;
but oh Thou who doest all things well, be pleased to look unto thy poor child,
and make her entirely willing to do as it agrees with thy will; bring her,
I humbly ask thee, to the state in which she ought to be,
in which she would ever be ready to say, "`Not my will, O Lord, but thine be done!`"

20th.--Once again downstairs.
Oh, since I was here before,
what has passed! surely much which ought to fill my poor heart with gratitude.
I have indeed been as it were on the verge of eternity, and,
with the arms of everlasting love for my support, I felt I was most truly happy,
happy in believing I was about to enter the realms of uninterrupted happiness;
but it has been the divine will that it should be otherwise, and oh,
I do now more than ever earnestly desire that my whole life may be the Lord`'s.

25th.--Stayed awake some time last night, and much enjoyed the stillness around me;
it was a lovely night, the stars looked very beautiful,
and reminded me of the 19th Psalm; it was a time I shall long remember,
for I was favoured to enjoy much peace.
Night feels to me particularly suited to meditation and devotion, especially in the city,
where all have their respective employments, and consider this a time of rest; and oh,
I do believe, in this great city,
many are the hearts which in this time of rest from bodily labour,
ascend to the throne of grace.

10mo. 3rd.--Dear Aunt M+++______+++ left.
At her advanced age it seems uncertain whether I may ever see her again;
I have often thought whilst looking at her that
she is not far from entering into her rest,
and oh, I have felt as if I should like to be in her situation,
for since my last illness, the joys of time have appeared as nothing in my view,
when compared to those of eternity.
But, however long I may be a sojourner here,
I trust I shall frequently be led by the "`still waters,`" to
taste of the living fountain which never faileth,
and which, even in this life, when resorted to,
gives a peace to the mind which nothing can deprive us of.

"`Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money;
come ye, buy and eat.`"
Precious invitation! why are we, many of us, so long in accepting it?

28th.--How much cause there is for watchfulness against "`the
enemies of our own house,`" these I have found to be almost
more difficult to strive against than those from without.

11mo. 2nd.--When going to give up a little thing in dress this morning,
and finding it very difficult to do so, these lines were brought forcibly to my mind--

[verse]
____
"`Be simply faithful to thy inward guide,
Heedless of mortal laugh or mortal frown,
And in thy Maker`'s service fortified,
Fear not the cross, for that secures the crown.`"
____

11mo. 8th, first day.--"`Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden,
and I will give you rest.`"
Dear Saviour! may I come unto thee--I who feel so undeserving of thy mercy!
Yes, even I may come to thee, for thou hast said that all may come unto thee;
give me oh blessed Jesus, give me I humbly ask thee more faith to believe.
Oh, make me more humble! bring down all which would exalt itself, and enable me,
when the praises of men are bestowed on me,
to turn inwards and ask myself the question--Where is there "`any good?`"
Thy praise alone is worth possessing, and oh, I do desire to seek Thine alone.

15th.--The last few days have been truly happy ones to me;
I have felt so much of the love of my heavenly Father!
How wonderful is it that He loves such poor weak creatures as we are;
without Him we can do no good thing.
How delightful is the thought that we have an High Priest who
can be touched with a feeling of our infirmities,
who, having Himself been tempted, is able to succour those who are tempted,
and not only able but willing to do so.
I am very much afraid of speaking of the faults of others; oh,
keep me from doing so my blessed Saviour; I feel that it is wrong,
and quite opposed to that charity which suffereth long and is kind.

1830, 1mo. 8th.--A day of trial to my poor mind.
Oh that I may do what is right without regard to the opinions of my friends.
How wonderfully are "`hard things made easy`" by
relying on the strength of an Almighty arm;
and it is only by placing confidence in the great Shepherd of Israel,
that we can expect preservation from the many dangers and temptations which surround.

11th.--Great is the Lord and greatly to be feared; yet, although this is the case,
how mercifully does He condescend to dwell with His dependent children,
how gently does He lead them, as it were step by step, in the path of safety,
if they have faith in Him.

25th.--Last night almost a sleepless one.
Suffering again my portion,
yet I still feel as if I could not sufficiently adore the hand that gives the blow!
Tried with wandering thoughts--oh that they were directed to the right source,
that they were more fixed on Him who ever remains to be a God of mercy and of love.

2mo. 22nd.--After nearly five months`' absence, arrived at home.
May I be strengthened to perform all that is required of me,
and oh that I may be brought nearer and nearer to my heavenly Father.

27th.--Took to my room,
yet it will prove no privation if I am able to have the dear children with me.
May I prize the quiet time I shall most likely have.
May I improve it, and oh may it be devoted to my Master`'s service.

28th.--Very earnestly do I desire, this day,
to be spared no trial or suffering which may be the means of purifying me,
or of making me of use to others.
Gave way to trifling conversation this morning, for which I feel self-reproach;
our first thoughts ought to be directed to the throne of grace.

5mo. 10th.--In this quiet spot (Durdham Down) may we
all be favoured to know an advancement in good;
how earnestly do I long to have my heart fixed constantly on the Rock of Ages,
that so I may be better able to point out to my precious sisters where they may,
in every hour of need, apply for strength.

27th.--During the last few months,
I feel that I have not been making much progress in the knowledge of spiritual things,
and under feelings of my own unworthiness, I venture to approach the footstool of mercy;
there, oh, blessed Jesus, I would seek forgiveness for the past,
and strength for the future.
Oh! draw me nearer unto thyself, that my soul may be satisfied with that living water,
which thou alone canst give.
Spare me, I humbly pray thee,
no affliction which would tend to prepare me for thy kingdom; but grant,
in thy unbounded mercy,
that thy unworthy child may become more meet for an inheritance incorruptible,
"`with the saints in light`"! For all my beloved friends,
but especially for those whom thou hast been pleased to entrust, in some degree,
to my care,
I would ask thy tender compassion--Oh! look upon these "`little ones,`" and
guide them to thy fold--that so in early life,
they may become as "`lights in the world.`"
Thou hast been pleased, I humbly believe,
to show--the deceitfulness of all the pleasures of this world; be thou near him, O Lord,
and stay not thy hand until the work is finished in his soul!
There is one other object of my tender affection for whom I would pray--one who is,
and ever will be inexpressibly dear to me--but I feel
my own weakness--yet coming to thee as my strength,
I would ask, that thou wouldst be pleased to guide her in thy paths,
that thou wouldst lead her by the hand gently onwards.
O show her how vain is every earthly joy, and teach her to seek her joy in thee!
One after another of our friends has been taken from us; and, in this way,
how continually art thou pleased to shew us, that "`this is not our rest.`"
Be thou also pleased to give us strength,
that we may be enabled to press towards "`the mark for
the prize,`" that when our earthly pilgrimage is ended,
we may be found prepared to partake of the "`rest which remaineth for thy people`"!

6mo. 5th.--Heard of dear E. M. F`'s illness, and most earnestly desire for her,
that she may be led by "`the still waters`" to taste of the water of life, and oh,
that as she approaches the end of her earthly pilgrimage,
her lamp may shine brighter and brighter!

13th.--Accounts of dear E. M. F. being much worse,
for her I would approach my Heavenly Father`'s footstool, and earnestly pray,
that in her passage through the "`dark valley,`" He will be with her and comfort her;
that He will hear her prayer, and grant her admission into his kingdom!
Dear Jesus! be thou pleased to strengthen her,
and enable her to give up her whole heart unto thee; that so,
she may not only be prepared for death, but able to look forward to it,
even "`with joy unspeakable and full of glory.`"

14th.--I know not how sufficiently to bless the hand which is
so continually conferring his blessings on his unworthy child.
This day I have been permitted to meet again one of my
beloved companions at +++______+++. We have again parted,
and the future seems lost in obscurity; but, blessed Saviour, may thy love unite us;
and oh, grant that we may rest at last in thy everlasting kingdom of peace and joy.

26th--My seventeenth birthday!
Another year of my life has rolled rapidly away,
and one which has been peculiarly marked with mercies.
Dear and ever adorable Redeemer, thou hast been pleased, in the past year,
to guide the wandering footsteps of thy unworthy child towards
an "`enduring city.`"--Through much and severe suffering,
thou hast led me gently onwards, and even enabled me at times,
to feel an all-powerful arm to be underneath me, when the billows have been so high,
as to appear almost overwhelming.
Thou hast brought me, indeed, through many and deep waters,
and hast sweetly revealed thy Almighty power to one of the little ones of thy flock;
accept from her, I humbly pray thee, the warmest gratitude!--oh,
still be pleased to lead her in thy ways,
as long as thou seest it right for her to remain a pilgrim here.
In thy wisdom thou hast been pleased to hide from us "`the measure of our days,`"--yet,
O Lord, seeing that life must ever be uncertain, and,
at the present time to me peculiarly so, be near me, I beseech thee,
in every hour of trial, and fit me, by whatever means thou seest best,
for thy kingdom of glory.
Again, I pray thee, let not thine hand spare, nor thine eye pity,
until the work of purification is accomplished in my soul--not until all that
remains of the dross and reprobate silver is entirely removed by the refining fire.

7mo. 2nd.--Heard last evening, that dear E. M. died last second day;
her trials are ended, and we may humbly believe,
that her purified spirit has obtained a mansion in the realms of bliss!
Beloved girl! may thy short tarriance here,
stimulate us to use increased diligence in seeking a more perfect knowledge of Jesus.
May He, who has led thee through the "`dark valley,`" and has, we trust,
granted thee an admission into His heavenly kingdom--may He,
the unslumbering Shepherd of Israel,
be pleased to be near us in our journey through life,
and at the end of our earthly pilgrimage,
permit us also to become partakers of the "`joys of His salvation`"!

11th.--Was strengthened to yield obedience to what I believe to be the call of duty,
and deeply feeling the nothingness of self,
approached the footstool of my Heavenly Father, on behalf of those present;
the sacrifice, I trust, was accepted,
for indescribably sweet was the peace which followed,
for which I feel that I have fresh cause to bless the Lord.

8mo. 3rd.--Nearly twelve months have now lapsed since I was first taken ill--
one attack after another has served since then to remind me of my uncertain
tarriance here--for some time my strength has increased,
and I have appeared and even thought myself getting well; but oh, my God,
thou hast been pleased to show me otherwise, and for this, I humbly desire to thank thee,
as well as for the love which still marks every dispensation of thy will concerning me.
Shouldst thou, in inscrutable wisdom,
yet be pleased to afflict thy unworthy child--
shouldst thou still see meet for me to suffer,
I can only ask of thee, strength sufficient for my need, and if this is granted me,
which I cannot doubt, most glad, yea, most truly thankful shall I be for any suffering.
At times, I feel as if the work was nearly finished, and should it be so,
should I have soon to pass through the dark valley, oh, blessed Saviour!
I must crave thy guidance and protection--I must
seek for refuge under the shadow of thy wings;
but, if thy divine will should be otherwise, if my days on earth are yet lengthened,
I must also beg thee to preserve thy wandering lamb--be near her in life, and make her,
I humbly pray thee, in death, a member of thy fold in heaven.
For my much-loved family I must entreat thy guidance--oh! make
them all members of thy "`church militant`" on earth,
and fit them, I humbly pray thee,
for thy church triumphant above--there may we all be counted
worthy of worshipping and praising thee forever!

12mo. 31st.--This day is the last of the most memorable year of my life;
in the furnace of affliction I have, during the last twelve months, been sweetly taught.
The Lord hath indeed done "`great things for me,`"
whereof may I ever acknowledge I "`am glad.`"
He hath opened, renewedly,
that fountain of living water which can alone refresh the thirsty soul,
and hath enabled me at times to rejoice in Him!
Again have I been brought, as it were, to the brink of the grave,
and again have I experienced the all-sufficiency of His power,
even in the hour when all human strength failed--
when the spirit seemed about to take its flight!
Mysterious are the ways of God to our finite reasoning, yet,
have we abundant cause to believe, that His will concerning us is always good.

Again restored to comparative health and strength,
my most fervent desire is to serve the Lord aright--to
follow Him in all things as long as I remain here.
Most earnestly do I at times crave that He will never leave me, but that,
in His unerring wisdom,
He will be pleased to chasten me in the way most tending to my purification,
that He will be my guide, even unto death!
Oh, gracious Saviour! let me never shrink from bearing thy cross;
oh! enable me to do it as I ought, for of myself I feel that I can make no safe steps.
In thy unbounded mercy still guide, I humbly pray thee,
thy wandering lamb towards the fold of thy everlasting rest.

1831, 1mo. 2nd.--Though an unworthy little one, permit me, O Lord,
to approach thy footstool on behalf of our society in this place; grant,
I earnestly petition, for Jesus`' sake, that our members may know an increase of true,
living faith; that faith which worketh by love to the purifying of the soul; for by this,
and this only, can we know an abiding in that which is good,
and an increasing sense of our own unworthiness;
in which state we can alone feel the necessity
of being clothed in the righteousness of Christ:
in Him, oh mercifully grant, that we may know ourselves complete;
that He may be unto us "`wisdom and righteousness,
sanctification and redemption.`"

5mo. 2nd. +++______+++ visited us, and addressed my dear parents,
and +++_______+++, and then myself.
Oh, how earnestly did he encourage me never to let go the hem of Christ`'s garment,
and always to sit at His footstool, and not only learn but do His will.
If kept very low I might be called, though it might be in a private way,
to hand the language of invitation to others; "`Come taste and see how good the Lord is.
If I kept close unto Jesus He would lead me in the green pastures of life.`"
Oh! may I indeed be strengthened to follow Christ in
all things!--may I cling closely unto Him,
who alone is able to satisfy his poor dependent
children with the food convenient for them.
"`Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.`"

London, 6mo. 3rd.--This evening has proved one of the most painful,
yet one of the most precious of my short life; my earnest request has been complied with,
and I have been brought most deeply to feel my own shortcomings,
my own many backslidings!
Oh! I have kept far behind my gracious guide, and when I remember His unutterable mercy,
when I reflect on His fathomless love toward me, I am almost overwhelmed with sorrow.
Oh! how do I desire that these feelings may continue, at least,
that they may so far do so, as to enable me to see how I may retrace my way, or, rather,
to drive me to that gracious Saviour from whom I have wandered, and who is yet,
I humbly trust, yea, firmly believe, ready to receive and to forgive.
Oh! thou, who still watchest over thy poor dependent little ones, be pleased,
I humbly pray thee, for Jesus`' sake, to look down upon me;
thou knowest that I do sincerely desire to serve thee, and thee alone;
oh! be thou pleased to strengthen my desires,
and to enable me now to follow the Lamb whithersoever he leadeth.
On my return home, O gracious Father, be pleased, in the multitude of thy mercies,
to watch over me, and grant me strength to go on my way,
for I am utterly unable to take one right step by myself.
Thou alone, O Lord, art mighty, and to thee belong glory and strength forever.

6mo. 10th.--This day is intended for the interment of dear S. T.`'s remains.
Oh how does my heart rejoice in the unclouded belief of his happiness;
safely landed on Emmanuel`'s shore,
he can now no more be assailed by the trials and conflicts of time.
Through infinite love he has, I cannot doubt,
obtained a blessed inheritance amongst the saints in
light! "`Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.`"

6mo. 19th.--Took leave of dear +++______+++, how sweet is the feeling
of union in Him who is the Head over all things to His church,
which is His body, the fulness of Him who filleth all in all.

26th.--Eighteenth birthday.
May I ever remember this day with gratitude;
in the morning much darkness seemed to cover me,
but in the evening the rays of the Sun of Righteousness
were graciously permitted to shine upon my soul,
and I have been richly fed with the heavenly manna!
May I be strengthened in the ensuing year to trust more constantly in Jesus,
to hold more frequent communion with the beloved of my soul.

7mo. 7th.--

[verse]
____
"`The dearest idol I have known,
Whate`'er that idol be,
Help me to tear it from thy throne
And worship only thee.`"
____

To worship God in spirit and in truth,
and to worship Him alone is the fervent desire of my soul,
yet oh! how feeble are my endeavours to serve Him aright.
Be pleased, O Lord, I humbly pray thee, for Jesus`' sake,
to teach thy unworthy little one, and to lead her in the way she should go; she humbly,
yet earnestly prays, that her thoughts, words, and actions,
may tend more and more to her Redeemer`'s praise!

'''

+++[+++Soon after writing the above, she was again stretched upon a sick bed, and brought,
in all human appearance, to the very entrance of the "`valley of the shadow of death.`"
The attack of disease alluded to, extended over many months, and, so gradual,
yet so sure was its progress, so entirely did it prostrate the bodily powers,
reducing the beloved sufferer to a state of extremest weakness,
that it seemed to the medical men who attended her,
as well as to the members of her own family,
that for her to be again raised up to health and strength,
would be little short of a miracle.
The sands in her glass did indeed appear to be well nigh run out, and, upon one occasion,
she took a most impressive leave of all the members of her beloved family,
with the servants,
and one or two kind relatives who shared the constant watch beside her pillow.
During the whole of the succeeding day she appeared sinking,
and the doctor expressed his opinion that she could not survive many hours.
Upon her mother`'s entering her room in the morning, and inquiring how she felt,
she replied, "`My dear mother I am very ill, but all is well!
The everlasting arms are beneath me,
bearing me above the swelling of the waves of Jordan.`"
In the evening the various members of the household, were summoned to her room,
as it appeared that the spirit was about to take its flight.
Whilst all were standing around her bed she thus addressed us:]

[.small-break]
'''

"`My dear parents, brothers, and sisters,
we are once more permitted to meet again in mutability,
and let me once more earnestly entreat you to choose the Lord for your portion,
who is leading me through the dark valley, and will, I humbly trust,
support me in that hour which I believe to be now nearly approaching.
May the evening of your day, my beloved parents,
be cheered by all the consolations of religion; and may you,
my beloved brothers and sisters, now in the morning of your day,
put your trust in Jesus Christ the Rock of Ages,
who will be your guide through life and your comfort in the hour of extremity,
if you unreservedly give up all to Him.

O sing unto the Lord a new song,
whose right hand and holy arm hath gotten Him the victory.
You will not long, I trust,
have reason to regret that one beloved object of
your affection has gone a little before you,
but oh may you place your confidence in that power in whom
alone your now nearly departed sister has found comfort,
by whose divine support death is deprived of its sting, and the grave, I humbly believe,
will be of its victory.

Now to Him who has dealt so wonderfully, so gently with me,
I can in confidence commend you, His protecting care will, I believe, be over you,
and oh may you be enabled to resign me into His hands,
who has done and still doeth all things well.`"

+++[+++During the following night, which will be long,
long remembered by those who were privileged to be witnesses of this scene,
it did appear, more than once, that the vital powers had ceased their play,
and a valued friend who held one of the dear patient`'s hands in her own,
and was feeling the pulse, looked up and said that they had ceased to beat.
For herself her mind was kept in perfect peace,
and from time to time she assured those around her,
that the valley (she was passing through) was not dark,
because illuminated by her dear Saviour`'s presence.

It was on a first day and from that time to the end of the week (seventh day,) she
remained in a state which precluded all hope of recovery,
or even of partial revival, and it seemed to the medical men,
matter of astonishment that she continued so long alive.
She partook of no nourishment during that time,
further than having her lips occasionally moistened.
Frequently the doors and windows were thrown open to give her air,
and four or five fans were constantly in use day and night.
On seventh day morning however she revived a little,
but the surgeon warned us that it was the revival which so often precedes dissolution,
and as such we regarded it; but, contrary to all expectation, He who worketh wondrously,
was pleased to stay the progress of the disease, and to say, "`damsel arise.`"

From that day her health gradually returned, and to our joy and wondering thankfulness,
our loved one was restored to us in a short time in comparative health and strength.
We many of us can well remember how her nature
shrunk from the prospect of a return to life,
and at thus being brought step by step back, and yet back, into the world`'s wilderness,
until she became persuaded that it was for a purpose of the Master`'s
glory she was thus raised from the bed of languishing,
and then was she brought to sweet and cheerful acquiescence in the divine will.
Soon after she began to revive,
and almost as soon as the probability of a
return to comparative health was admitted by her,
a deep and abiding impression seemed to rest upon her mind,
that it was for some especial purpose she was thus brought back to earth,
when her work seemed so nearly accomplished,
her race so nearly run--and in seeking to know the divine will concerning her,
and desiring to see the pathway in which it was
the purpose of her good Master she should tread,
the remembrance of a near relative, who had widely wandered from the paths of virtue,
was accompanied by an abiding belief,
that it was to be of use to him that her sojourn
in the wilderness had been thus lengthened.

The following letter was written during this illness to her relatives, in the belief,
that it would, probably, be the last she would be able to address to them.]

[.embedded-content-document.letter]

[.salutation]
To my beloved brothers and sisters:

Whilst deeply feeling my own weakness,
I have sometimes been almost ready to shrink from what I have long felt to be my duty,
in thus writing to you; yet, the idea of being, in any way,
made an instrument of good to my fellow creatures,
and more especially to those so nearly connected and so dear to me,
has at length induced me to begin this,
to endeavour to use my feeble efforts to advance the cause of truth and righteousness;
and should it be, in the least degree, of use to either of you, my efforts will indeed,
be more than repaid.
I have, of late, been led more and more to consider the great uncertainty of life,
and it is under the impression that I shall not long be with you, that I now address you;
and oh! how earnestly do I desire, that we may all so live,
as to be counted worthy of an admittance into that kingdom,`" where no foe enters,
and no friend departs.`"
It-matters little, our being early called to a separation on earth,
if we can joyfully look forward to a re-union in heaven!

My dear brothers and sisters! let me entreat you
always to begin and finish the day with prayer;
in the morning seek direction to act rightly during the day.
I have found from experience that I can, of myself, do no good thing,
or even think a good thought--and do you not find it to be your case also?
Then remember, for your comfort, that you may go to Jesus; fly to Him in every trial,
and you will, I believe, find that His grace "`is sufficient for you,
and His strength made perfect in weakness.`"
I believe you would find devoting your first thoughts
to your Creator of very great benefit to you,
and I long that you may draw nigh to God in prayer, at all times in the day.
He will not despise the prayer of even the weakest of His children,
if offered in sincerity.
Then come unto Him, my beloved brothers and sisters;
seek Him "`in the morning of your day, and assuredly He will be found of you, and will,
if followed,
conduct you in safety--amidst whatever trials He may in mercy permit
on your journey--to that haven where no storms can reach!

Most affectionately do I entreat you all to give up your whole hearts unto the Lord,
and whilst endeavouring, under His direction, to perform the duties of this life,
never to forget to prepare for another:
even in what are termed "`little things,`" attend
diligently to the "`still small voice,`" which has,
I believe, been heard, and, in some degree, obeyed, by many of you; but always remember,
that the whole heart must be surrendered.
We "`cannot serve two masters,`" yet how sweetly encouraging is it,
that if we seek first "`the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
all things necessary will be added thereto`"! To some of you,
the Christian`'s path may often have appeared a trying one; but let me assure you,
the trials and sufferings which are permitted to
attend the traveller Zionward--and of which,
in some degree,
I have been a partaker--are indeed "`not worthy to be
compared`" to the joy which is set before them.
We must bear the cross, before we can expect to receive the crown;
and most earnestly do I desire, that all my beloved family may "`so run,
that they may obtain`"!

My long confinement has led me, perhaps,
peculiarly to prize a silent waiting upon God--a part
of the day set aside for the purpose of serving Him;
but, my dear brothers and sisters,
I was also favoured to prize this privilege whilst in health.
I felt my weakness to be very great,
and found many times that I could not well proceed on my way without
seeking "`a renewal of strength;`" and I feel at this time,
a renewed conviction that you must also do this,
if you would proceed on your journey towards Zion--look not back,
but press forwards in the way of righteousness,
even in "`the narrow way of the redeemed!`"
The prospect of parting from you,
and especially from those amongst you whom I have been endeavouring to lead to Jesus,
and leaving you to proceed on your way as it were alone, has at times felt very painful;
but to Him who has so sweetly, so graciously led me onwards--to Him,
my beloved brothers and sister--I believe I may commend you; and oh,
that you may be made willing, in all things, to follow that Master, who,
whilst personally on earth, Himself said, "`My yoke is easy, and my burden light.`"

It appears most probable, that my journey will soon be ended; you may, perhaps,
long continue sojourners in this "`wilderness,`" yet,
keep your eyes constantly fixed on the heavenly Canaan, as your place of rest; and,
though years may be added to your lives, we shall not seem long divided.

My much loved family! my beloved parents, and dear brothers and sisters,
let me express my earnest desire, my fervent prayer,
that we may meet in heaven--in that land of uninterrupted happiness,
to which I humbly trust I am hastening.
There, I cannot but rejoice at the hope which is sometimes permitted me,
of our all meeting around the throne of our adorable Redeemer.
Oh that we may all be counted worthy to join in singing,
"`Alleluia`" to His name forever!

12mo. 15th.--Under renewed feelings of heartfelt
gratitude to the great Giver of all good,
I am at this time induced to note down the merciful dealings of my heavenly Father,
towards one of His very unworthy little ones,
whilst treading in a path which she had not known and which
was outwardly strewed with difficulties and trials.
In the latter end of the 10th month, 1830, after a long and severe illness,
my life seemed fast approaching its close,
and I looked forward with "`joy unspeakable`"--and, I trust,
with a well grounded hope of immortality--to an early
entrance on the inheritance of "`the saints in light.`"
I rejoiced in the unclouded prospect which was graciously permitted me,
of joining the blessed company who have come out of great tribulation,`" and who,
having washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb,
are now forever before the throne of God.
But He, whose ways are not as our ways, was pleased, no doubt in unerring wisdom,
to stay the hand which appeared stretched out to draw me to Himself; and,
in a love too perfect for our finite comprehension, He saw meet to detain me here below.

On the 29th of tenth month, after lying for a week as on the very verge of eternity,
I revived a little, and to my own astonishment, as well as to that of all my friends,
hope again prevailed in some minds respecting my recovery.
For two weeks, or nearly so, the things of time seemed entirely lost to me;
my mind was mercifully kept in perfect peace, being stayed on the Lord; and though,
when He was pleased to manifest His will concerning me, in my longer tarriance on earth,
I was ready to query, "`What doest Thou?`"
I could always rest in confidence that the Judge of the whole earth would do right,
although the purposes of His dispensations are often hid from our eyes.
Before I was able to move in my bed without assistance,
my heavenly Father was graciously pleased to shew me the path in which I was to walk;
it was one from which my nature shrunk;
but when I remembered what great things my God had done for me,
I was made willing to do or suffer any thing for His sake.

Whilst I was gradually sinking, apparently to the grave, +++_______+++,
who had long wandered in the paths of transgression,
was an object of much anxious concern to me,
and though for a season I was spared all anxiety, even on his account,
this was the first earthly subject which was permitted
deeply to impress my mind on returning to life;
and for him, in much wisdom, I believed, unworthy as I was,
I was brought back to a scene of trial, to which I thought I had forever bid adieu.
The words, "`for this cause have I raised thee up,
for to show in thee my power,`" were almost constantly with me,
I earnestly desired to be made ready to perform any work which
my gracious Master might be pleased to appoint,
knowing that He who has all power in His hands,
could strengthen even the weakest of His creatures to work for Him and His name.

For a considerable time it was thought most
probable by my friends and medical attendants,
that I should, as long as life was spared, continue to be an invalid;
this prospect would have been far from a painful one, yet I could not but sincerely hope,
that if the work, for which I believed I was brought back to life, was of the Lord,
I might be at least so far restored to health and strength,
as to cause no hesitation on this account in the minds of my friends,
to my leaving home for a season.
This hope was mercifully realized,
and in the beginning of the year I believed it right to
tell my dear mother of the prospect before me;
although she felt much with and for me, she was, I believe, made willing to give me up,
trusting that I might be strengthened to fulfill the work appointed for me to do.

My mother soon after left home, and, daring her absence,
I mentioned to my father the trying path I thought I should have to walk in;
never can I forget the evening on which I did this; my own weakness seemed overwhelming,
and, for a time,
I thought I must altogether relinquish what I still believed the path of duty.
The remembrance of the passage, "`He that knoweth his Lord`'s will, and doeth it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes`" painfully arrested my attention,
and I dared not resist the precious visitation of the Most High.
I prayed for strength to tell my father all, and I was indeed sweetly helped;
he made scarcely any opposition to my plans,
and now my way seemed clearer than it had before done;
and it appeared best for me to go to +++_______+++, and there wait for my daily work.

Truly might it be said, the future was hid from my eyes.
It was not until the 7th month that I left home,
and the trial of doing so was made much easier than I had anticipated.
I felt that I was in the hands of a compassionate Father,
and I was willing to resign myself to Him,
to do or bear whatsoever He might see meet for me.

[.offset]
+++[+++Here follow many details of her experience, which, from their reference to others,
it seems undesirable to insert.]

She writes, on the 10th month, 2nd, "`I have known much of the Christian warfare;
I have had frequently to walk in rough paths;
but my heavenly Shepherd has been graciously pleased, at seasons,
to comfort and sustain me, to bear me above the waves of my troubled sea,
which at times have risen very high!
Still may I thankfully acknowledge in my small experience,
that God has not forgotten to be gracious,
nor in anger has He shut up His tender mercies.

I returned home the 14th of the 10th month, after being absent more than three months,
during which time I devoted my attention almost entirely to +++_______+++,
though obliged sometimes, indeed, regularly to engage in my ordinary employments.`"

[.offset]
+++[+++1831.--She now entered diligently, and with deep interest,
into the employment of instructing her younger brothers and sisters.
On the 12th month, 25th, she writes:]

25th.--I have had, this evening, some interesting conversation with my little brothers.
Dear, precious children! already do they appear to see the love of God,
in sending His only begotten Son into the world to save sinners.
Oh that they may early become followers of their crucified Saviour!

1832, 4mo. 30th.--Another month is coming to a close, and oh,
have I made any progress in it towards my
heavenly home--"`the prize of my high calling.`"
Tardily, I fear, have I proceeded on my way;
yet I do long to be more faithful--I do earnestly desire to press forwards,
leaving the things which are behind.
Oh, how would I crave, that nothing earthly, no joy or treasure here,
may prevent my laying up for myself a treasure in heaven, where it will last forever!
My ties to life are many and varied;
too often am I ready to cleave to that which is mortal,
but I do long to be weaned from this--I do with sincerity
desire ever to remember that this is not my resting-place!
Delightful thought! our home in Heaven!
Through the merits and mediation of our Saviour,
we may look forward to the possession of an inheritance "`eternal in the heavens!`"

5mo. 6th.--This afternoon I have felt almost overwhelmed with the belief,
that want of faithfulness on my part has been
the means of preventing the advancement of many,
dear to me, in the way of life.
In the name of my blessed Saviour, who has done such great things for me,
I earnestly beseech thee, O Lord, to look down upon me,
and enable me faithfully to follow thee; oh guide me by thy own right hand,
support me by thy never-failing arm of strength, and preserve me from evil.
I have wandered again and again from thee, and I know that without thee I can do nothing;
enable me to say, with the Apostle,
"`I can do all things through Christ strengthening me.`"

6mo. 26th.--On first awaking, this morning,
the remembrance of this being my nineteenth birthday,
excited mingled feelings in my breast.
Whilst reflecting on the many backslidings during the past year, and humbled, I trust,
under a sense of my great unworthiness,
the goodness of God "`causeth me to hope,`" and enables me to fly for refuge to the
compassionate Friend of sinners--may He be more and more my all in all.

12mo. 15th.--"`And their soul shall be as a watered garden;
and they shall not sorrow any more at all.`"
Whilst this gracious promise was powerfully presented to my mind yesterday,
I was most sweetly enabled to believe that I
should find it fulfilled in my own experience;
and though now I cannot suppose that all will be bright in my passage through life,
I can still trust that my heavenly Father`'s will may be so much my will,
that I shall ever be able to acknowledge that all is well and rightly ordered.
Whilst sitting in meeting, I was led reverently to desire,
that my beloved friend +++_______+++ might also taste of the water of life.
Oh, how do I long that her poor shattered bark may enter the haven of rest.
Oh Thou, who alone canst heal the wounded breast,
pour into her soul the balm of true consolation, and enable her to rejoice in Him,
who has given Himself for her.

1833, l mo.
6th.--Attended meeting.
During the last few days my bodily strength has been much increased,
and I know not how sufficiently to bless the Lord for all His mercies.
I have today been renewedly led to desire the prosperity of Zion! oh,
how do I long for its increase!
Oh, thou who rulest over all, look down, I humbly pray thee, for Jesus`' sake,
upon this part of thy vineyard--"`save thy people, and bless thy inheritance.`"
Increase, I humbly pray Thee, that faith in thy beloved Son,
that faith which worketh by love, to the purifying of the soul!
Wash me, O gracious Father, and prepare me, I earnestly crave,
as a vessel for thy own use; do with me as seemeth thee good,
and make me all I ought to be.
During the last week, I have, in an especial manner,
desired to see an increase of Christian love amongst us; oh,
how I do desire that this may increase and abound.

13th.--This evening gave way, in some degree, to unprofitable conversation.
Do thou, O gracious Lord, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
more and more bring into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;
enable me to say, with the Apostle, "`I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live;
yet the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me,
and gave Himself for me.`"

19th.--Felt much sympathy this morning with dear +++______+++. Oh how do I
desire that the faithful standard bearers may be strengthened,
that they may go on their way with joy;
much have I desired this day the advancement of
that which is good in our society in this place.
In the afternoon tried with the children; I think I could do, or bear,
almost any thing for them,
if I could but see them yielding their hearts to the Prince of Peace.
Dear Jesus! take them, I humbly pray thee, into thy own hands, and make me,
as thou seest fit, an instrument of good to them.
I desire more and more to bear in mind,
that "`though Paul may plant and Apollos water,`" that
it is thou alone who canst give the increase.

2mo. 12th.--Much enjoyed this evening hearing some letters,
written by a believer in Jesus; and oh, how do I long that I may, like her,
be taken again and again to the chambers of imagery,
that I may be indeed enabled to see my own utter insufficiency,
even to think a good thought,
and that thus I may be strengthened to acknowledge the power of Him who hath redeemed us.

2mo. 16th.--The children went to Olveston.
Much have I enjoyed the outward stillness, which has consequently been ours,
but still more have I prized the peace which has mercifully been given me of God.
Oh, how do I long to glorify Him more--to live more as a ransomed
sinner ought to live! "`Do thou O Lord open my lips,
and my tongue will show forth thy praise;`" increase, I humbly pray thee,
for my Saviour`'s sake, my sense of my own infirmities;
make me to see myself as I really am, and enable me in sincerity to adopt the language,
"`Do with me as seemeth thee good, for I am thy servant.`"
I have this evening, renewedly and earnestly,
desired the best welfare of each member of my beloved family;
oh that they all may be citizens of Zion,
knowing their robes to be washed and made white in a Saviour`'s blood!
For my friends also, all of them, but for some in an especial manner,
to whom I have this evening felt most nearly united,
I have sincerely raised a petition that they may
know a being filled with the "`fulness of God.`"
May they, or may she particularly, though chastened, never be killed; though cast down,
never be destroyed; but ere long we favoured to partake, in a small degree, at least,
of that peace which passeth all understanding.

23rd.--Another week come to a close, and one of much toil and bustle.
The prospect of another lay of rest is most comforting; oh how delightful,
how inexpressibly sweet will it be, to rest forever "`in Jesus!`"
But though to depart and be with Him would, I can humbly hope, be great gain, yet,
to "`abide in the flesh`" may be more needful for me,
and I desire to be enabled to acknowledge, with the great Apostle,
that "`to live is Christ,`" as well as "`to die is gain.`"

4mo. 7th.--The last few days I have been brought into deep,
and almost overwhelming sympathy with my friend +++_______+++, and oh how earnestly do I crave,
that her way may be made clear before her, and that she may, ere long,
see that she has cause to trust, and not be afraid;
she has known the judgments of the Lord, and I cannot but believe the time will arrive,
when she will gratefully acknowledge that they have
been better for her than what may appear great mercies.
May she be preserved from all evil.

10th.--Whilst contemplating the future path of my endeared friend,
I have been led reverently to crave that she may not be permitted to slide,
but that she may perform the will of her heavenly Father concerning her,
that she may do that only which is right in His sight.
Do thou guide her, O gracious Lord, and for thy dear Son`'s sake,
lead her by thy own right hand in the green pastures of life: be thou her shield,
and also her exceeding great reward!
Tomorrow, our little working party^
footnote:[In allusion to a little company of young friends who met together weekly,
and devoted a few hours to working for the poor.]
will, I believe, again assemble here,
and I much desire that strength may be given me to perform my duty properly:
I am of myself most weak and frail, but Christ is all-sufficient.
May He be my strength.

5mo. 12th.--In recurring to the events of the past day,
I am indeed grateful to my great Creator for His many mercies;
He has fed me with the hidden manna,
and though it has not been prized as it ought to have been,
I humbly trust it may prove as bread cast upon the waters.
Deeply unworthy, as I know I am, of divine love and mercy, I can humbly,
firmly trust that it will be again and again extended towards me,
and that my heavenly guide, will be near me, even unto death.
Oh may the divine blessing rest on the precious children!

17th.--Tomorrow I am likely to leave home for London,
where I humbly trust I may experience a renewal of strength--
may I be truly humbled under a sense of my own great weakness,
and made more sensibly to feel the exceeding sinfulness and depravity of our natures;
oh I long to feel sin more exceeding sinful,
and to be more deeply brought to a sense of the unutterable mercy of God in Christ Jesus;
I long, most earnestly, to know more of Him as a reprover of sin,
for although deep may be the suffering caused by this knowledge,
it must be profitable for us.
Oh I do so long to be truly humble and faithful.

6mo. 12th.--When I awoke this morning,
my desires were not as fervent as they ought to have been to go rightly on my way,
yet after breakfast, during my quiet moments, I was favoured, I trust,
with a sweet and real evidence of being under divine protection;
the mercy of the Most High was, in a striking manner, brought before my view,
and from it I may, I hope, derive a little strength to proceed on my way.
"`As far as the east is from the west,
so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.`"
How gracious is this assurance!

Thought much of the dear children oh that I may be strengthened to
fulfill the duties required at my hands towards them;
how unworthy am I of the privilege of leading them to Jesus,
yet much do I desire not to abuse this privilege, and to be kept truly humble.

13th.--Again gave way to unprofitable conversation in the morning,
when I ought to be seeking strength to go onwards;
oh when shall I be guarded enough in this respect.
After breakfast, bodily suffering prevented my attending properly to my spiritual duties.
How necessary, how very necessary is it in time of health and strength,
to lay up our treasure in heaven.

+++_______+++ spent the evening with us; had some conversation with her on serious subjects;
she endeavoured to encourage me, and entreated me not to be too much cast down.
But I have not kept as closely to my gracious Guide as I ought to have done.
May no pang be spared me,
no trial of any kind calculated to bring me nearer to my Saviour, the Lamb of God.
Parted from dear +++_______+++, with the probability of many years, at least, passing away,
ere we may again be permitted to meet, but we shall, I humbly trust, meet in spirit,
and oh that we may be strengthened to pray for each other!
In recurring to the events of this day, gratitude is the covering of my spirit.
"`14th.-Awoke under a precious sense of divine love,
and my desires were earnest to keep close to my heavenly guide; but after breakfast,
I was unwatchful,
and spent too much time in listening to conversation
relating to the trifling things of time.
"`Set a watch, O Lord, upon my mouth, keep the door of my lips.`"

Again went to meeting.
+++______+++ spoke in a striking manner on the text, "`Stand fast, therefore,
in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made you free.`"
Most applicably did he speak to my situation, and I think encouragingly;
oh that his advice may be blessed to my soul.
Tried during part of the meeting with wandering thoughts;
and on my return home gave way to feelings of depression.
My path is, at seasons, as in the very depths of the sea,
but oh that I may not be permitted to let go the hem of Christ`'s garment,
or to make shipwreck of the grain of faith with which I have been favoured.
In the evening, a young friend was with us, who is in very delicate health,
and who is about to leave home on account of it.
I have earnestly desired, in my conversation with her,
to dwell on those subjects which are connected with that which is eternal.
I do long to see her established in the faith, built upon the Rock of Ages,
yet how weak am I, how utterly unqualified of myself to lead others onwards.
May she be taught of God!
I fear I have, this evening, too much listened to some things spoken against others;
I took no part in talking against them, but I feel condemned, and truly justly so,
for so far taking a part as to listen.
Favoured in the evening with renewed desires to press forward in the heavenly race.

15th.--Another very busy morning,
and my thoughts too much engaged with the things of time.
Wrote several notes;
oh that I may be preserved from saying more than I
really feel in intercourse with my beloved friends.

In the evening, called on +++_______+++, who seems deeply tried;
may she be supported and comforted by Him,
who alone can effectually heal the wounds of His people.
When I returned home, I was much cast down,
and scarcely able do I now feel to adopt even the petition,
"`God be merciful to me a sinner,`" so overwhelming is the sense of my frailty.

17th.--My thoughts still sadly wandering from things eternal!
Oh how weak and frail I am!
My unwearied adversary seems on every side endeavouring to draw me away, and I know not,
at seasons, what will become of me, but this, at others,
I can believe to be a temptation, for, Has my gracious Saviour said,
and will He not do it--has He promised, and will He not bring it to pass?
He who has, in unutterable mercy, permitted me to partake, in a small degree,
of the glorious liberty of the sons and daughters of God, will not, I believe,
now cast me off; but though He cause grief, He will yet have compassion,
"`according to the multitude of His mercies.`"

20th.--This morning, arose with feeble desires to perform my duties rightly,
and was strengthened, during the time I passed with the children, to go on nicely.
A quiet morning,
and I was mostly preserved from that portion of suffering
which has of late so frequently been permitted me.
Bless the Lord O my soul; in much love has He been pleased, I confidently believe,
to afflict me.

In the evening, I was again permitted a season of extreme anguish,
from the overwhelming fear of having retarded the children`'s progress Zionward,
for want of entire faithfulness.
Oh that this suffering may have the designed effect,
although it does indeed appear as a "`fiery baptism;`" still, however,
would I humbly crave,
that no trial may be spared me calculated to bring me nearer to Jesus.

[verse]
____
"`Amidst my list of blessing infinite,
Stands this the foremost
That my heart has bled!`"
____

And it is the fervent prayer of my soul that I may, again and again,
be brought through the refiner`'s fire,
until all that belongs to the old man and his deeds is entirely subdued.

25th.--Arose this morning with sincere desires that this last day of my nineteenth year,
may be a satisfactory one in every respect--that I may indeed keep close to Jesus!
In the morning I was strengthened to attend to the dear children comfortably,
and I trust profitably.
Before going to meeting, was far too much disturbed by a few little trying circumstances.
At meeting my thoughts wandered much, and I knew very little settlement;
oh when shall I have them fixed constantly on Jesus!
After meeting I said something to a friend which I fear was wrong,
for which I have suffered much.
In the afternoon I found it very trying to sit with the children,
but afterwards received a little comfort from that text--"`If we confess our sins,
He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness`"! In the evening,
went to walk with the dear children,
and was permitted a small portion of sweetly sustaining peace, both during it,
and afterwards.
In recurring to the last twelve months,
my heart has been deeply impressed with the goodness of the Lord.
He has dealt with me in unutterable love; my feet have oftentimes strayed from Him;
I have, as a lost sheep, wandered from Him;
yet has He been graciously pleased to follow me; and often has He, in much mercy,
condescended to be my strength in weakness,`" and
prepared for me "`a table in the wilderness.`"

26th.--This morning I have been led very earnestly to desire,
that all my remaining days on earth may be entirely devoted to Him
who has been pleased to draw me by the cords of love unto Himself!
Oh how fervently do I crave His protection during the ensuing year,
should life be granted for so long a period.

Evening.--I have been tenderly dealt with this day.
Under a deep and almost overwhelming sense of my
many great deficiencies in the past year,
yet also sweetly sensible of my heavenly Father`'s
continued lovingkindness and never failing compassion,
I have desired to renew my covenant with Him, and, from this day,
to resign myself into the hands of my gracious Lord--only longing, only craving,
that His will concerning me may be accomplished, and that I may be His forever.

27th,--In the evening was favoured to know an increase of strength;
the all-sufficiency of the atoning sacrifice was brought sweetly before my view,
with a renewed conviction of the necessity of knowing the washing of regeneration,
and renewing of the Holy Ghost--"`that we may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.`"

28th.--May I this day be kept faithful.
I have this morning, as well as last evening,
sincerely desired to see clearly what is right for me to do
respecting the part which I have agreed to take in the Bible
Society--"`to do good and to communicate forget not,
for with such sacrifices God is well pleased,`" has been much impressed on my mind.
May I be rightly directed.

30th. On my return home from meeting,
I enjoyed a short time of quiet in "`my closet;`" I have been cheered with a ray of hope,
that through the merits and intercession of our compassionate Saviour,
I may be permitted, in the Lord`'s time, (which I know, I am fully persuaded,
is the best time,) to enter that kingdom,
where there will be no temptation to stray from Him who hath redeemed us,
but where we shall forever praise His great and glorious name.

7mo. 1st.--In the evening I was, I fear, unwatchful with the children;
I long to see them really living as children of God,
and yet I fear I do not touch them as I ought to follow Christ.
Oh that His Holy Spirit may be shed abroad in their hearts and my own,
and that they may be enabled to cling closely to Him
who would lead them into the green pastures of life.

6th.--This morning I occasioned myself much suffering by endeavouring
to pierce the veil which hides futurity from our view.
"`The things which are revealed belong unto us,
but the hidden things belong unto the Lord our God,`" and it is
highly important that we should endeavour to live one day at a time.

7mo. 9th.--In the evening was permitted sweetly to partake of
the peace "`which from believing flows,`" and was enabled
confidently to rest in "`hope of the glory of God.`"
May I be kept steadfast!
May I be enabled to comprehend the length and breadth of the love of God.

15th.--My thoughts wandered much in my hour of retirement this morning,
but after breakfast I was favoured with earnest desires
to keep close to Jesus.--In school all the morning,
and much enjoyed a few minutes quiet before dinner;
truly do I find in my experience that the more difficult it is to obtain it,
the more highly we prize silent retirement.

24th.--Very much engaged all the morning, preparing for +++_______+++ leaving us.
Much have we all felt parting from him; and the dangers to which he will be exposed,
have come before me in a painful manner,
and have indeed greatly increased the trial of parting with him.
I have endeavoured at this time to commit him to the care of Israel`'s Shepherd, to whom,
I humbly trust, he will be drawn by the cords of love.

8mo. 1st.--This morning I have earnestly desired
strength to perform all my duties in a right spirit.
Attended to the dear children with more satisfaction than sometimes.
I much fear having any form in attending to their highest duties.
Closely occupied during the morning,
but was mercifully preserved from feeling engrossed with earthly things.
In the evening favoured to know an increase of strength, but, was, I fear,
rather unwatchful with the dear children.
Oh that I was more deeply humbled under a sense of my many infirmities.

3rd.--Arose very early, and much enjoyed the delightful quietness that surrounded us;
yet my thoughts wandered much whilst endeavouring to seek a renewal of my strength;
and I was greatly tried with feelings of spiritual pride.
Oh how do I desire that I may be brought low,
and that everything which would exalt itself in my heart may be laid low,
even with the dust--but I require much, very much, to make me humble.

In recurring to the past week, whilst I am, I trust,
truly thankful for the desires I have been strengthened to feel after holiness,
I am also deeply sensible of having yielded to many,
very many of the temptations of our unwearied adversary,
who lays snares for our feet on every side.
I have this evening sincerely longed to be enabled to lay aside every weight,
and the sin which doth so easily beset me,
and to run with patience the race set before me,
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.

6th.--When I rose this morning I felt so very weary,
that it seemed best for me to relinquish the idea of going to meeting, which I did;
but at home was favoured with ability to draw nigh to God, through my gracious Saviour.
Oh how do I desire this day to be brought very low, to be made really humble.
Read an account to the servants of a poor woman who was a great sufferer,
but who was supported by religion; they seemed much interested in it;
oh that it may have a beneficial effect on them.

Thought much of dearest +++_______+++,
and fervently desired that the Lord`'s will concerning her may be
fully done--that she may be strengthened to see that it is good.
In the evening some young friends of ours called.
I was, I trust,
preserved from trifling conversation--indeed this has been a favoured day,
the retrospect of which is very precious.
May I be more and more devoted to my heavenly Father`'s service, for in His,
and His only, is perfect freedom.

10th.--I have, during the past week,
often been permitted to rejoice in the God of my salvation; and though I have,
at seasons, gone mourning on my way, my heart is filled with thankfulness,
in the remembrance of past and present mercies,
and I long to devote my life more entirely to Him who hath done great things for me.
This time four years I had my first dangerous attack of inflammation;
since then how often have I seen the power of the Lord, how often,
as in the depths of the sea,
has He been pleased to manifest Himself as a God of mercy and of love; and,
blessed forever be His name,
He who was graciously pleased to draw near and support me in sickness,
has not now forsaken me, but, in unutterable love, is still pleased to follow me,
and lead me in his path.

11th.--In the evening meeting, permitted largely to partake of sweetly sustaining peace.
Very fervent have my desires been to become more completely
the Lord`'s. "`As the hart panteth after the water-brooks,
so panteth my soul after thee,
O God,`" is at this time the language of my truly thirsty soul.
At night, very happy.

12th.--In the evening much tried with +++_______+++, and, I fear,
I hardly pursued the right path with her or
+++_______+++. A cloud has been thus cast over my way,
which has been so sweetly smoothed the last two days; at seasons,
I have been permitted such sweet peace in believing,
that I could hardly expect to be long continued to me;
earth would afford too bright an abode if such were the case.
I feel thankful, therefore, for suffering, that thus,
again and again I may be reminded that my home is not here.

31st.--Deeply impressed, during the whole of the day,
with the accounts we have this week heard, of very sudden removals; and oh,
how earnestly do I long, in recurring to the past few weeks,
that I may be strengthened more faithfully to follow Christ Jesus, my gracious Shepherd!
Oh, how inexpressibly delightful, would be the prospect of seeing Him as He is,
to be forever with Him, and never, never sin.

9mo. 11th.--Did not get up to breakfast,
and my first thoughts too much fixed on my dearest earthly friends; I was, however,
afterwards enabled to turn them to things eternal!
Oh, that these light visitations of sickness may prove as messages of love to my soul!
I desire that no suffering of any kind may be spared me,
calculated to bring me nearer to Him, whom, not having seen, I love.
In the morning school strengthened to go on satisfactorily.
In the afternoon, rather tried with the children.
In the evening, again felt very weary, and retired to rest early.

20th.--I have again known a little of bodily suffering,
but again have I also known the Lord`'s arm made bare for my support; and I have,
afresh experienced Him to be "`a refuge from the storm.`"
Oh, how do I desire,
that each tempestuous billow permitted to assail my frail and shattered bark,
may bring it nearer that celestial haven, where all is rest and peace.
Much do I desire that my late indisposition may have the designed effect,
even of bringing me nearer Him, whom to know is life eternal.

25th.--The two last days I have been gradually recovering, and today I feel much better,
though I am not strong enough to bear much; I am, therefore,
prevented the privilege of being at our quarterly meeting; yet,
though not permitted to be out,
I have this morning sweetly experienced communion with the beloved of my soul;
and I have indeed found the presence of the Comforter
to be inexpressibly precious and consoling.
May Israel`'s unslumbering Shepherd still condescend to watch over and protect me,
as I go on my way,
and whatsoever trials are permitted to be my portion on my journey through life,
all will in the end, I doubt not, be joy, and peace, and rest.

10mo. 2nd.--In the evening I was, for a short time,
quite overcome with the remembrance of my once
early prospect of admission into the city of God,
and with reflecting on the path which now lies before me; but still,
I do rejoice in the strength of an Almighty arm--I do rest in humble hope
that my all-sufficient Saviour will be ever near to guide and support me.

3rd.--Permitted to enjoy this morning a season of sweet refreshment,
as from the presence of the Lord; oh,
how inexpressibly precious is communion with the
Beloved! how far surpassing every earthly joy!
I would indeed rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God,
than dwell in the tents of wickedness, however pleasant these may at times appear.

6th.--Continued poor accounts of dearest +++_______+++ have made me very anxious about her,
and I have given way to too much weakness when thinking of her;
but this morning I have been graciously strengthened to commit her with confidence
to the care of Him who has dealt with her in a manner so inscrutable to us,
and who will not, I humbly trust, leave her,
until she has a well grounded hope of "`acceptance in the Beloved.`"
Much do I desire that every affliction permitted to
attend her may bring her nearer the source of all good!
In the contemplation of danger in her present attack,
the fervent prayer of my soul has been, that she may not be taken from amongst us,
till she has found Him to be her Saviour whom she has so long sought sorrowing.
I felt comforted in the remembrance of the promises,
"`Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father, in my name, He will give it you; and,
if ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.`"

17th.--My thoughts wandered too much, on first waking this morning, to earthly things;
may they, during the day, be more fixed on things eternal!
The uncertainty of life has again been very deeply impressed on my mind--and
I do long to live in a state of entire preparation for death,
that, should the solemn messenger be sent to my dwelling at an unexpected moment, I may,
through the undeserved mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
be permitted to enter that state of blessedness where all is rest and peace forevermore!
During this day, the things of time have pressed heavily upon my spirit,
but I have been strengthened to look upward for help.
Oh, how good the Lord is!

27th.--When I awoke this morning, my mind was too little alive to things eternal; but,
after rising,
I was favoured with renewed desires to be enabled to "`press towards the mark,`" etc.
Oh thou, whose mercies are over all thy works, be pleased, I pray thee,
for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to draw near to thy unworthy child this day--lead her
in whatever way thou seest right for her to walk in,
only be thou with her,
and she will receive with thankfulness the cup of sorrow or of joy.

11 mo.
8th.--Went to meeting,
where I was mercifully permitted to know sweet access to the throne of grace.
Dwelt much on the importance of fixing the thoughts,
immediately on entering meeting on the object for which we meet
together--truly it is not right to suffer our thoughts to rest,
even for a little while, on the passing scene around us; and for myself,
I do long from this day to be strengthened to keep to the resolution I have formed,
not to look around, even whilst the meeting is assembling.

24th.--In the evening meeting I was favoured to know
sweet and very near access unto the throne of grace,
where I was enabled to pray fervently, in Jesus`' name, for many who are dear to me;
and for myself, I craved an increase of faith.
Oh how I long that all which exalts itself may be brought low;
that I may be really humbled;
that I may be made willing to do or suffer any thing for Christ`'s sake,
and be strengthened to ascribe all the glory to Him to whom alone it is due.
May the ensuing week be passed in more close
watchfulness over the enemies of my own house,
which threaten at times to mar, or even destroy my peace.

12mo. 2nd--+++_______+++ was with us for two hours, and was sweetly engaged on our behalf.
After speaking for some time,
and addressing my dear parents and brothers and sisters collectively, she said,
in a very impressive manner,
"`And perhaps I may be permitted to address an individual who has been highly favoured.
Oh thou who hast been permitted to see the wonders of the Lord in the deeps,
and who hast been enabled to tell to others what great thing God has done for thee;
mayest thou be strengthened to keep thy covenant with a covenant keeping God,
who keepeth covenant with the day and with the night,
and who is worthy to receive praise, honour, and glory forever!`"
Oh that I may indeed be strengthened to keep my covenant--to
pay the vows I have made when I have been in trouble.
May I be more deeply humbled under a sense of my manifold infirmities,
and be enabled continually to abide at Jesus`' feet.

17th.--Woke this morning feeling very poorly, but permitted much "`joy in believing.`"
My Saviour has been this morning unspeakably precious to my soul.

19th.--Derived much comfort from the sweet assurance, "`Ye are all the children of God,
by faith in Christ Jesus.`"
Felt much oppressed in body most of the day--fully can I now, I think,
understand the expression of the great Apostle, "`for in this tabernacle we groan,
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven!`"

29th.--Did not go to meeting,
but had a little time of quietness with +++_______+++ and +++_______+++,
when I was brought to feel in a small degree my many
deficiencies--oh how do I long more deeply to do so.
Do thou be pleased, gracious Father, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to make me more deeply sensible of the great deceitfulness of sin,
and of the efficacy of the atoning blood.
Oh be thou pleased to make me more truly humble--
more deeply dependent on thy almighty power;
purge away my sins for Jesus`' sake, and make me thine, and thine only forever!

1834, 1mo. 1st.--Earnestly do I this morning desire,
that in the ensuing year I may be enabled closely to follow Jesus.
Oh be thou pleased, gracious and all-merciful God, for His sake, to look down,
to succour and protect thy weak, unworthy little one;
hold thou her up and she will be safe; keep her from the snares which surround her;
and oh, be pleased to preserve her, to deliver her from the fear of man;
grant her ability to press forwards in her heavenly journey,
to leave the things which are behind!
This day I desire to renew, and oh that I may be enabled to keep, my covenant with thee,
but I know that of myself I can do nothing; be thou pleased, for Jesus`' sake,
to be my strength in weakness.

7th.--My thoughts so much fixed this morning on dearest +++_______+++,
that I have found difficulty in turning them to things eternal;
I fear I am too much wrapped up in many of my earthly friends--how do I, at this time,
long for ability to hold the gift in subordination to the Giver.
Attended the monthly meeting--painfully interested do I
feel on behalf of our society in this place;
and oh, how do I long to see an increase of that love amongst us which casteth out fear.

26th.--After six days of much outward bustle,
inexpressibly precious is the thought of a day of rest!
Oh how glorious must be the rest to be enjoyed in the eternal sabbath.

28th.--Went to meeting,
where I knew much of what may justly be compared to "`wandering on the dark mountains.`"
Oh how delightful will it be again to walk in the green pastures of life.
I desire not, however, to murmur at my allotted portion,
but thankfully to receive it as from a Father`'s hand.

3mo. 8th.--Again rose very early;
and fervently have I this morning craved divine protection.
Oh that I may not this day be too much engaged with the things of time.
After a very busy morning,
much enjoyed a few minutes quietness--these short seasons of retirement are,
to me as "`brooks by the way,`" so refreshing are they to my often weary spirit.

17th.--Oh that in this day, in every step of my journey,
I may experience the help and guidance of Israel`'s unslumbering
Shepherd! may I be preserved from taking one step alone.
A satisfactory morning.
Tried in the afternoon with +++_______+++,
but afterwards enabled to find safety and comfort at the footstool of Jesus.
Went to +++_______+++`'s, where the spirit of heaviness was indeed mine,
in the remembrance of days when I have enjoyed sweet communion
with "`the Beloved`"--yet I was not without hope that it would,
ere long, be changed for the garments of praise.
Oh may I be more humbled.

26th.--Rose with earnest desires to be preserved from "`all evil.`"
I have lately, I fear, dwelt too much on the happiness,
the blessedness of being "`forever with the Lord.`"
I now earnestly long to examine closely the reasons of this,
and oh may I indeed be made resigned to live, as well as willing to die!
May I be kept faithful.

A busy morning,
but my thoughts mercifully fixed on those things which relate to my everlasting peace.
Called on some friends of ours in the afternoon,
and though I trust mercifully preserved from saying any thing wrong,
or calculated to injure any,
I still mourn over a want of constantly knowing my thoughts
brought into subjection to the obedience of Christ.

29th.--Very earnestly did I this morning desire
preservation from the dangers which surround;
and this can only be had by my eyes being ever turned "`towards the Lord!`"
As usual, much occupied with mundane things,
but my thoughts mostly fixed on those which are "`unseen.`"
Towards the close of the morning unwatchful--oh that I may be more faithful!
A busy afternoon and evening.
In recurring to the past week,
deep gratitude ought to clothe my spirit towards Him who has
renewed and strengthened my desires of being His forever!
May I indeed be permitted,
again and again to pass through "`the refining fire,`"
till I am graciously enabled to adopt the language,
"`For we are dead, and our life is hid with Christ in God.

Clevedon, 5mo. 11th.--Rose late,
yet very fervently did I desire this day to be preserved from any kind of disobedience.
My only place of safety, I know, is at "`the feet of Jesus`"--there may I abide this day!
Sat in meeting with my dear mother and +++_______+++ in the morning,
and I have to mourn over sadly wandering thoughts;
yet I knew some fervent desires after more entire devotedness
and complete holiness of life--increase these,
I pray thee, O gracious Father, for my Saviour`'s sake; subdue my will,
and make it thine, O Lord!
Was permitted, afterwards, in my own room, to derive comfort from the promise of Christ,
"`Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.`"
After tea read to the dear children;
afterwards heard a little reading from the Memoir of S. Huntingdon.
May I never forget the privileged season I afterwards had in my quiet chamber.
I was enabled to pour out my whole soul at the throne of grace,
on my own behalf and that of all my friends; of all the society also; of the oppressed,
and those who are labouring for them; and for the whole human race!
I thank thee, O thou great Author of all my blessings,
for having permitted me this evening to approach thee in the name of thy beloved Son,
for whose sake I pray thee,
at this time to enable me to surrender myself more fully unto thee.
Oh that I may live to thee alone! and may I be preserved from wandering from thy ways,
which I know are only right.
My beloved +++_______+++`'s birthday; oh that she may, in the ensuing year,
make progress in the path of life.

12th.--A quiet afternoon.
My mind mercifully kept in a great degree of peace,
for which I desire to feel truly thankful.
Much enjoyed watching the sun set; and this glorious sight has produced feelings,
I trust, of real devotion!
Oh how do I desire that outward objects may more and more
constantly turn my attention to those which are spiritual.
At night, earthly things too much engaged my thoughts,
but I was enabled to look unto Jesus for help and guidance in
them--oh that He may ever be my counsellor and friend!

21st.--I long to experience the truth of the sweet assurance of the Apostle,
"`Sin shall not have dominion over you.`"
After having penned the above, deeply ought I to be humbled in acknowledging,
that today I have again yielded to temptation,
which often assails me--giving up to my own will, instead of looking for help to Jesus,
whilst deeply feeling my frailty.
May I be enabled, in future, to look more continually to Him;
His unbounded mercy causes me to trust that He will forgive my backsliding,
and continue to love me freely.

6mo. 1st.--I have recurred to the events, etc. of the last month.
Truly thankful do I feel for the help which I have experienced
in it from my heavenly Guide for proceeding on my way;
and very earnestly do I long, in the ensuing one,
to know my faith in Christ increased--even that faith which worketh by love,
"`to the purifying of the heart.`"
Never, I think, have I known more ardent and constant longings than of late,
after complete dedication; and I long to have every idol removed,
which takes the place my Saviour ought to have in my heart.
Oh teach me, gracious Father, for His sake, what thou wouldst have me to do; and oh,
spare not thine hand, nor let thine eye pity, till thou hast entirely subdued my will,
and made it thine.
During the last two days I have been tempted in
a way to which I have long been a stranger;
it has served again to remind me of my frailty,
and has led me to look more earnestly for help from
above--may I be preserved from yielding to it!
The sweet promises, "`My grace is sufficient for thee,`" etc.;
and "`Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is
stayed on thee,`" were comforting to my soul,
and tended to encourage confidence in the everlasting arm.

14th.--Through unwatchfulness in the evening suffered loss.
Was not careful enough in speaking to one of my sisters.
Afterwards met with many interruptions, before being able to obtain quietness,
having neglected it in the right time;
but in deep self-abasement I was enabled at length to approach the divine footstool,
and there to seek forgiveness for my sins of omission and commission,
and crave ability to pursue my way in greater faithfulness.
May I this night, in recurring to the events of the past week, be deeply humbled,
and afresh incited to diligence.
Oh that tomorrow, should it dawn on me, may be a day of rest unto my soul--or rather,
may it be a season of renewed devotedness.
But why should I wait for another day?
To-night, even this hour, O gracious God, I would, through thy help,
surrender myself to thy all-wise disposal; for the sake of thy beloved Son,
enable me to submit myself to thy holy will.

19th.--My mind much engrossed with the prospect of my path this day, and, at seasons,
it has seemed almost overwhelming; but I trust in the mercy of my heavenly Father,
who has, hitherto, dealt so tenderly with me.

21st.--The enemy of souls assailed my frail heart with many temptations,
but I was mercifully enabled afterwards to find a renewal of my strength;
and some gracious promises were sweetly brought to my remembrance,
which afforded comfort and support--oh, may I be truly humbled!
In the afternoon again tried with temptation, similar,
but not so severe as that in the morning;
my heavenly Father has again graciously helped me--all praise, all glory be to Him alone!
After an evening of much outward toil,
when my spirit was too much bowed down to the earth,
I was permitted to enjoy a few minutes quietness,
when in remembrance of the past week my heart was covered with gratitude,
and with most earnest desires to be kept faithful.
How sweet is rest after a toiling day--oh, how much more sweet,
how inexpressibly precious,
will be that rest which remaineth for the people of God in heaven.

26th.--My birthday!
Oh thou, who hast in day past been near to thy unworthy child, to shield her from evil,
be pleased, I pray thee, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to strengthen me in the ensuing year, or rather,
day by day feed me with the food convenient for me--may I be so led and guided,
that my thoughts may be brought into subjection.
Humble me, and prove me, O Lord, in whatever way thou seest best,
only enable me closely to follow thee, to yield an unreserved obedience to thy will;
increase my weak faith, give me a deeper sense of sin, and enable me, I humbly ask thee,
to grow in grace and in the knowledge of my Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, to whom,
and to thee, O gracious Father, be all praise forever ascribed.
In recurring to some of the events of the past year, and of the path,
wherein I have walked, I am, I trust, deeply humbled under a sense of my shortcomings;
whilst at the same time,
I feel renewed cause to trust in the Lord--to give myself more entirely to Him.
Very earnest, at seasons, have my desires been in the last year to become wholly His,
and this evening they have been very sweetly and strongly renewed;
my heart has been deeply bowed in fervent longings after ability to become
entirely dedicated--may every step I take be calculated to work for my good,
may I be preserved from taking one alone.
For my precious charge I have earnestly craved divine protection.
Though often discouraged, whilst endeavouring, in the strength mercifully afforded,
to sow the seed in their hearts, I have been this evening encouraged to persevere,
in humble hope that it may prove as "`bread cast upon the waters.`"
A very satisfactory evening.
I was graciously enabled to do something which was very trying in prospect,
but which was made easy to me; oh I have indeed cause to trust in the arm of Omnipotence.

[.offset]
+++[+++In the sixth month, 1834, she paid another visit to +++_______+++,
where her relative resided,
upon whose account she had been so long and so deeply interested.]

28th.--Awoke about three o`'clock,
and truly may I say that my spirit has been deeply bowed before the Lord, in fervent,
earnest cravings on behalf of my beloved family, and on my own account.
In my absence how do I desire that they may be preserved from all evil, and that I,
unworthy as I am of divine protection,
may indeed experience the support of the everlasting arm,
in the path which lies before me; may my faith be increased,
and may I indeed be permitted to know a much closer walk with God.
During the day I was mercifully preserved from fearing the future,
but as I drew towards +++_______+++, and when I reached it,
I felt at times almost overwhelmed with the prospect before me;
still I desire not to be spared suffering,
I only long to be enabled to pursue the right path.

7mo. 9th.--Withersoever thou sendest I will go, and whatsoever thou commandest I will do,
I desire may be the language of my soul.
Had a satisfactory call on +++_______+++. Returned home with feelings of thankfulness,
and with renewed desires after that life which is hid with Christ in God.

13th.--O God, my heart is fixed!
This sweet language was, on first waking this morning,
brought very impressively to my remembrance,
with sincere desires to be enabled entirely to adopt it.

21st.--Suffered loss by yielding to a small temptation.
The great enemy of our souls`' peace has today much assaulted me,
and at seasons I have yielded too much to his baits,
but having been permitted to see some of them, I trust I may, from this time,
be preserved from them.
Oh that I may be more deeply sensible of my own weakness,
and my entire dependence for all help upon my gracious Saviour.
I retired to rest with heartfelt gratitude the covering
of my spirit towards Him against whom I have sinned,
but whose unutterable love and mercy cause me to hope.
All my beloved family, and many friends brought sweetly to my remembrance;
and I was enabled to approach the throne of grace on their, as well as my own behalf.

23rd.--Some conversation with my beloved S+++______+++ has much impressed my heart,
and has raised the renewed desire in my soul to be kept very close to Him whose I am,
and whom I desire alone to serve.

My spirit has been bowed down in remembrance of what I heard this morning;
yet it has incited renewed longings after holiness, for myself and those dear to me;
and oh that the arm of divine power maybe spread over us,
shielding and protecting us from evil; still the many dangers which surround,
at seasons deeply oppress my spirit;
and I am thus continually reminded that though the spirit is willing,
the flesh is very weak.
May this knowledge make me more earnest in pursuing the path of life!--more
dependent for all help on my gracious guide and friend.

25th.--Arose this morning with feelings of much thankfulness,
on finding my poor body much refreshed by sleep, and ready for the exertion of the day,
also with earnest desires to be permitted to know the
canopy of divine love and power to be spread over me.
In my time of quietness, my thoughts wandered too much to terrestrial things,
still I knew something of that "`wrestling in prayer,`" which I
humbly trust will procure the blessing of preservation from evil.
With +++_______+++. Strengthened to allude to some of the events of his past life,
and during my conversation, and since, I could not but humbly hope for him.
After we parted, I was permitted to enjoy sweet peace.
Oh that my life may be more devoted to my God, more unreservedly given up to Him.

In the retrospect of the past day,
heartfelt gratitude ought to prevail towards Him who has watched over me,
and increased or renewed my desires to be His alone forever.
This evening he has been graciously near me,
and enabled me to approach his sacred footstool on my own behalf,
and that of many of my dearest friends.
Oh that we may all be more and more guided by the spirit of Christ,
and be strengthened to overcome, in life or conversation,
all which is opposed to its precious influence.

26th.--Enabled, more than has sometimes been the case, to resist a little temptation,
which has lately much assailed me, and to which I have too often yielded.
In the morning, read, and heard part of the memoir of Thomason,
a devoted missionary in India, and, I trust,
I have known renewed real desires after ability to give myself up more entirely to God.

"`That which I see not show thou me`" is this evening the desire of my soul!
I long to be taught more and more of God--to know Him continually to be my counsellor.
Do thou, O my gracious God, for my Saviour`'s sake,
enable me to pass a life of closer communion with thee; look down, I pray thee,
on thy unworthy little one, and lead her onwards; be pleased, also,
to look on each member of her beloved family, on all her relatives,
and her many dear friends; and pour upon all of them, for Jesus`' sake,
the spirit of grace and supplication--oh enable them to enter into covenant with thee.
Grant that in the ensuing week, I may be strengthened to walk closely in thy ways; and,
tomorrow, in an especial manner, be thou pleased to be near thy poor frail child,
and preserve her from, in any way, dishonouring thee.
Grant these requests, she humbly craves, for the sake of Him who died,
"`the just for the unjust`"--who has been, and is touched,
with the feeling of the infirmity of thy poor creature.

27th.--I am ready to believe, I have suffered loss this morning,
from having yesterday sought strength for the duties of today, gathering, as it were,
manna for two days--yet I have been comforted in remembrance of the promise,
that "`whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive`";
and I do confidently trust that this day I shall receive help of God--oh,
that I may constantly feel my dependance on Him.
Much had I felt the prospect of going to +++_______+++ to spend the day,
yet looking upwards for help,
I was mercifully strengthened to abide on the watch-tower--though
deeply and painfully feeling the apparent state of things around me.
Oh, how do I long to see the sabbath more observed, more given up to devotedness to God!
How do I long to see the young in this meeting come forwards,
and declare by their lives on whose side they are.
Spent the evening with dearest S+++______+++. How do I long for her
establishment and advancement in the truth as it is in Jesus.

30th.--Had a satisfactory call on +++_______+++, and a peaceful walk home.
In meeting,
my spirit was bowed in heartfelt desires for my
precious S+++______+++`'s advancement in the path of life;
and, oh,
how do I desire that I may be her companion in seeking durable riches and righteousness,
and that I may be made all that my heavenly Father would have me to be,
though I may be led as through the depths of the sea.
In the afternoon spoke to the disadvantage of another,
which cost me suffering in the retrospect.
Oh that all my words were what they ought to be!

8mo. 1st.--Rose with earnest desires to be enabled to act faithfully,
and be strengthened in the ensuing month to go forwards in the right way.
Very early were the poor slaves brought to my remembrance,
with feelings of thankfulness to Him who ruleth over all,
and with heartfelt longings that they, and that all who are bound by the chains of sin,
may be delivered from them--"`be turned from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God.`"
Saw a poor man during my walk in the evening whose appearance much struck me,
and I went to procure a tract for him,
which I trust may be blest to his soul by Him who willeth not the death of a sinner.
On my retiring to rest, unspeakable gratitude was the covering of my spirit,
for the many blessings strewed in my way.
The joy of the Lord, I was permitted graciously to know, for a season, to be my strength,
in which I have again fervently desired to know a
continuance of heartfelt longings after holiness.

3rd.--Heard from home.
It is likely that my return will be rather sooner than I expected,
but I rejoice in believing that I have been here in the right time--
and now I must inquire diligently if all has been done required of me.
Oh that I may this evening be preserved from excitement,
and be permitted to know a renewal of strength.
In the afternoon my thoughts were not so much fixed on
divine things as ought to have been the case.
In the evening prevented, by the weather, from attending meeting.
Sat down at home with +++_______+++ and +++_______+++. Soon after doing so,
I was impressed with the belief that my heavenly Father
was pleased to require an offering at my hands,
which my nature so shrunk from giving,
that I allowed the silence prevailing around me to be broken up;
but it would not do--if I neglected this opportunity,
I know that I should feel condemnation for disobeying
what I believed to be the voice of the Lord.
After passing through a season of deep conflict,
most graciously was I strengthened to address my
dear relatives--sweet peace has followed,
and this I would thankfully receive as an evidence of divine favour.
At the same time I most earnestly long, that if I have run, when not really sent,
I may be convinced of it; yea,
that my heart may be purged from it by "`the spirit of judgment and the spirit of
burning!`"--that the whole work of the Lord may be carried on and perfected.
Sweet peace permitted to be my portion the whole of the rest of the evening, for which,
may I indeed offer the tribute of heartfelt thankfulness.

7th. The oil of joy for mourning,
has this morning sweetly been permitted to be my
experience--the garment of praise has been my covering;
and heartfelt desires have I renewedly known after
ability to give myself up wholly to the Lord,
and to follow my gracious Saviour in whatever paths He may be
pleased to lead--even should it be in those of deep suffering.
May I this day be strengthened from above for all my need.
Very mercifully strengthened to do what I believed was required with +++_______+++.
All, all is peace,
and my heart is filled with unbounded gratitude to my God for His numberless mercies.
Took leave of my beloved C+++______+++ friends,
and had a very peaceful ride to +++_______+++ cottage.
The remembrance of boundless mercies received during my stay
at +++_______+++ incited in my heart sincere thankfulness,
and at the same time earnest desires to become more wholly the
Lord`'s. My dearest S+++______+++ much mentally with me.
Retired to rest with renewed longings that we may both be
strengthened to press towards the mark for the prize of our
high calling in Christ Jesus and commending her soul and mine,
with all who are dear to me, to His preserving care this night.

9th.--Returned to Bristol.
Woke with remembering that I am this day likely to enter again upon my home duties,
and with earnest longings after preservation from the dangers
which surround on the right hand and on the left.
Ere I quitted +++_______+++,
a season was permitted me which I trust may never be forgotten--unutterable peace,
which might indeed be compared to a river, was my portion;
thankfully could I adopt the language, "`My soul doth magnify the Lord,
and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.`"
Too sweet too precious are such moments as these to be long granted us here.
But although this sweet foretaste of heavenly joy--for to
nothing else can I compare it--was for a short season,
a calm succeeded, which continued uninterrupted till my arrival at home,
whilst humble confidence and heartfelt desires were the covering of my spirit.
And now, returned to my beloved home,
I desire renewedly to offer the tribute of gratitude
for the innumerable mercies I have received,
and afresh to give myself up to Him who has dealt with me in such unutterable love.
Make me, O gracious God, all that thou wouldst have me to be--for my Saviour`'s sake,
shed thy Spirit upon me, and carry forwards thy work in my soul;
strengthen me for all thou mayest require at my hand, and subdue, I pray thee,
all that remains in my heart opposed to thy righteous government.
Oh enable me to go in and out before thee, in a manner acceptable in thy sight;
and from this day guide me, I pray thee, by thy counsel,
and in thy own good time receive me to glory--for whom have I in heaven but thee,
and there is none upon earth whom I desire beside thee.

13th.--Spent most of the day in Leigh Woods,
where I humbly trust I was preserved from doing harm to any one;
but I am more and more convinced, that it is not right for me, when I can avoid it,
to mix with those, at least at present,
who are not decided followers of the Lamb--who do not
know Him to be the centre of all their joys.
My thoughts were not sufficiently fixed on things eternal.
At night, felt it an unspeakable privilege to have a little quietness,
when I was graciously enabled to commit afresh my way unto the Lord,
trusting that He will grant ability to perform all His will, to keep me close to Him.

14th.--After breakfast,
permitted to know a few minutes sweet access to the throne of grace,
on behalf of my precious S+++______+++,
to whom my heart has this morning felt bound in a peculiar manner.
Oh that he may be kept in the secret place of the Most High,
and there may we know sweet communion.
At noon read the account of the Israelites making the calf;
and most earnestly have I desired that I may be permitted to suffer
for making any idol which may be compared to that of the Israelites.
Oh, may the Lord alone be my God.

16th.--In recurring to the events of the past week,
gratitude was the covering of my spirit,
in the belief that I have been preserved from doing
harm to the precious cause of righteousness;
whilst at the same time the remembrance of many, many shortcomings,
ought deeply to humble me; in some degree, I trust, they have done so,
and incited more earnest desires for a closer walking with God.
May my heavenly Shepherd, become more and more my all in all;
may it be more and more my meat and drink to do His holy will.
Sweet peace was permitted to be my portion ere I
retired to rest--I could indeed "`rejoice in the Lord,
and joy in the God of my salvation.`"
Oh, that my body, soul, and spirit, may be entirely His forever.

23rd.--The retrospect of the past week is deeply,
painfully interesting--strikingly have some of the
events proved the instability of all things here;
and whilst this has been much impressed upon my heart, renewed desires have arisen there,
that I may be found abiding at the feet of Jesus;
but the things of time have too much engaged my attention, and many, very many,
have been my shortcomings--still the mercy of my heavenly Shepherd has been unfailing,
and as I write, I feel bound to acknowledge, with heartfelt gratitude,
that to me it has been new every morning.
Oh how great is His faithfulness! may I be enabled more and more to trust in Him.

24th.--I have known much of that "`groaning which cannot be uttered,`"
described by the Apostle;
and so fervent have been my longings after entire
deliverance from the bondage of corruption,
as to appear too much for my poor body to sustain.
On my return from meeting, experienced relief from this by a flood of tears,
but my desires continued earnest to be strengthened to yield myself up, body, soul,
and spirit, unto the Lord--to be made whatever He pleases me to be,
to become as clay in His hands.
Sin does indeed appear "`exceeding sinful,`" yet I long that it may seem more so,
and that even my thoughts may be brought into subjection to the obedience of Christ.

26th.--In meeting I was mercifully preserved in watchfulness unto prayer.
In the meeting for business my spirit was deeply bowed before the Lord.
My name was mentioned as representative to the next quarterly meeting.
Under a deep sense of my weakness, I was ready to refuse, when the words,
"`be still and know that I am God,`" were
sweetly and powerfully brought to my remembrance.
His gracious promise, "`Fear thou not,
for I am with thee,`" etc. has since been so present with me,
that I do confidently trust I have not done wrong in accepting the appointment,
which I cannot but feel is a renewed call for diligence,
a fresh incitement to faithfulness.

31st.--The great enemy of souls has this morning endeavoured to shake the faith of mine,
but in unspeakable mercy, in my season of retirement,
I was strengthened to find in the "`quiet habitation,`" a refuge from the storm;
and heartfelt have been my desires after an ability faithfully to pursue my way.
May nothing separate me from the love of Christ,
and oh how do I long to be made "`complete in Him.`"

On behalf of my younger sisters, especially,
has my spirit been bowed in heartfelt longings--oh that
they may be led into the fold of the good Shepherd.

9mo. 10th.--Heard this evening a distressing account of J. B+++______+++. Oh that,
through redeeming mercy,
she may be prepared for the solemn hour of death! oh
that this last messenger may be disrobed of his terrors;
that she may be strengthened to commit her all to that compassionate Saviour,
who has deprived, to the believer, death of its sting, and the grave of victory;
and may I be deeply instructed by her situation--
may I be incited to use increased diligence,
to keep my lamp ever burning with the light of divine love.

15th.--Rose feeling much refreshed in body,
for which I desire to be truly thankful--oh may I this day be kept at Jesus`' feet.
Heard many deep and interesting particulars of dear J. B+++______+++.
The contemplation of her near approach to the eternal world,
has very deeply impressed my heart, and I have renewedly craved divine assistance,
to come entirely "`out of the world!`"
For a short season,
almost overwhelming was the thought of being still exposed to its snares and its dangers,
but in unspeakable mercy, the sweet promise,
"`The Lord will preserve thee from all evil,`" etc. was permitted to comfort me,
and to incite renewed confidence in the God of my salvation.

20th.--Lord I will follow thee whithersoever thou leadest,
is this morning the language of my soul.
A very busy morning and afternoon,
but I was mercifully preserved from feelings of much excitement.

The love and mercy of my heavenly Shepherd have, during the last week,
been afresh and preciously manifested towards His very unworthy child;
and oh that in the ensuing one,
I may be enabled with fresh diligence to pursue my
journey Zionward--may every thought be scrutinized;
may I be strengthened to bring all things to the light,
that it may be made manifest which are wrought of God.
May He be graciously pleased to strengthen me to
lead my precious charge in the right way,
and to teach them, by example as well as precept,
the excellency of the truth as it is in Jesus.

23rd.--Arose early,
and felt much refreshed--a feeling to which I have lately been a stranger,
and which demands my heartfelt thankfulness to the Giver of all good.
I heard something yesterday which has caused me to desire strength from above,
to preserve me from feelings of exultation;
truly to me belongeth nothing but blushing and confusion of face, and I earnestly longed,
that under a sense of this, I may be deeply humbled.
After a busy morning, when I was much occupied with outward things,
I felt a short time of quietness unspeakably precious, in which,
under a deep sense of my many wants, I was enabled to approach the mercy-seat,
to seek a supply of strength from Him, who alone is able to help and protect me.
Oh may the bond of my covenant be strengthened, and never, never be loosed.

28th.--Dear J. B+++______+++`'s remains were this day to be committed to the dust;
and oh how do I rejoice in believing that she is
safely sheltered from all the storms of life,
in the haven of everlasting rest.
"`Oh how inexpressibly precious is the thought
of freedom from sin--my soul longs after it;
it does indeed "`pant after God, even as the hart panteth after the water-brooks.`"
In meeting, the greater part of the time, my desires after holiness were very fervent;
but for some time I was much tried with wandering thoughts, again being tempted,
as I so often used to be,
to endeavour to pierce the veil which so mercifully hides futurity from our view.
After a season of trial, divine help was graciously afforded; and in my return home,
most earnestly did I long that this favour might continue to be extended.

10mo. 12th.--Much darkness covered my way this morning:
I seemed scarcely able to "`look up;`" yet, in a short season of quietness,
I was strengthened to desire,
that as long as it might be good for me to be thus dealt with,
I may be preserved from unfaithfulness.
In meeting, a cloud continued to darken my way,
yet I did fervently long to be preserved in faithfulness.
In the afternoon mercifully strengthened to get on satisfactorily with the dear children;
for this favour I desire to feel heartfelt thankfulness;
I had hardly dared to hope for it, for my mind was so obscured,
that I could scarcely see my way.
My heavenly Father has dealt tenderly with me,
and though He may yet be pleased for me to walk as in darkness, I humbly, fervently hope,
He will preserve me from doing harm to others.

19th.--"`Blessed is the man that endureth temptation.`"
In a season of darkness, this sweet passage was comforting to my soul,
and oh may I be strengthened to trust in the Lord, and to stay my mind upon my God.
In our little meeting (Clevedon) again permitted to walk in darkness,
and to see no light; yet, in the depth of suffering, the language of my soul is,
"`Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.`"
Though the billows may roll around me,
I humbly trust they will never be permitted to shake my
confidence in the strength of my all-powerful Pilot;
and though He may be pleased to try my faith, as to a hair`'s breadth,
I do trust He will enable me to confide in the bond of the covenant.

22nd.--In a season of retirement,
very gratefully did I hail a beam of light upon my lately darkened way.
The events of this day four years much in my thoughts;
all the beloved friends who then watched over, what appeared to be my dying bed,
brought most sweetly to my remembrance--for each of them have I craved divine protection,
and for myself how have I longed for increased ability
to pursue my onward way--for more devotedness of heart.
May I long remember the hours of suffering I have lately had, to my deep instruction,
should they now for a season be exchanged for brighter days; but, oh,
may these be regarded with unspeakable thankfulness,
and may I be able to give them up when it is again seen best for me to walk in darkness;
yet, oh, how do I fear, as I write, that, through unfaithfulness,
I may lose the ray of light.
Gracious Father! be pleased, for the sake of thy beloved Son, to strengthen my hands,
and enable me to become wholly and unreservedly thine, to whom all power belongs,
and in whose protection alone can I find safety.

11mo. 30th.--Another month is come to a close, and what advancement hast thou made,
my soul, in the way everlasting?
Have I made any straight steps to my feet?
Through unutterable mercy,
I have been permitted at seasons to know an increase of desire after heavenly good;
but I have not so constantly proved, by my life and conversation,
that I have been "`with Jesus,`" as ought to have been the case;
and in recurring to the last four weeks,
whilst unbounded gratitude fills my heart for the preservation experienced,
my spirit craves increased ability to serve my God and Saviour.
Oh, may I, in the ensuing month be strengthened more faithfully to pursue my heavenly way.

12mo. 4th.--In our several calls this day,
I trust I was preserved from saying any thing wrong,
but my thoughts were not sufficiently fixed on eternal things--twice,
when surrounded by company, I was strengthened to leave,
and in a few minutes quietness permitted to know renewal of strength.
I cannot go safely on without continually seeking divine protection,
my feet slide if my eyes are not ever towards the Lord,

18th.--Dear +++_______+++`'s twenty-third birthday.
Ere another year has passed she will, most probably, have entered an untried path;
but oh, how earnestly do I desire, that she may be led and guided by Him,
with whom is no variableness nor shadow of turning.
How do I long that the canopy of His love may be, in much mercy, extended over her,
in all her steps in life`'s rugged way.

27th.--In the last week, my spirit has often been oppressed with discouragement,
my hands have often been ready to hang down in the work assigned me, I believe,
by my heavenly Shepherd; but I do at this season, feel renewed confidence,
that He will bless the labours made for His name amongst His little ones; and I long,
in the retrospect of the past week, whilst humbled under a sense of my own unworthiness,
to be enabled more steadily to press forwards, more constantly looking unto Jesus,
in whose strength alone can I hope to conquer my many spiritual enemies.
Oh how blessed will be the time, when all of them will be forever subdued, and,
through unmerited mercy, I shall, I humbly trust,
be made more than conqueror through "`Him who loved me,`"--the thought is animating,
and ought to incite to renewed diligence.

1835, 1mo. 15th.--During a more than usually bustling morning,
my mind mercifully preserved from excitement, and I had a few minutes stillness,
which were precious and refreshing to my spirit.
Afternoon and evening bustling ones, yet was I graciously helped from above;
and on retiring to rest, much wearied in body, the song of gratitude ought to be mine,
to the Author of all good.
Oh, may I, in the morning, rise "`rejoicing in His love.`"

24th.--Much prized a longer time than usual for retirement,
when I earnestly desired ability to keep on the watch tower,
in the midst of outward bustle.
In recurring, in the afternoon, to the events of the past week,
I desire afresh to acknowledge the mercy of my heavenly Father:
and oh may I be strengthened, with full purpose of heart, to cleave unto,
and serve Him who dealeth with me in great compassion and paternal
love--this has been the experience of my soul this evening.
Spoke quickly to my dear mother; and under a sense of my infirmity,
I have endeavoured with the strength graciously afforded me,
to approach the footstool of divine mercy,
and there have I afresh been permitted to feel the
precious privilege of knowing that my Redeemer liveth,
and that He liveth to intercede for His little ones, in the presence of the Father; and,
oh, how does this knowledge incite the desire, that sin may not have dominion over me,
but that I may be strengthened to yield up my body, soul, and spirit,
more unreservedly to my heavenly Father.

2mo. 5th.--"`He knoweth our frame, and remembereth that we are dust.`"
Among the many trials which surround us,
and the weakness which we must all feel to be ours,
it is an unspeakable comfort to remember this--and not this only,
but also that He is abundantly able and willing to help to the very uttermost,
all who desire to come unto Him.

13th.--Had but a few minutes stillness after tea,
but in them I was permitted to know near access to the throne of grace,
and my spirit was refreshed thereby.
Oh, how full is the fountain, to which the thirsty soul may have access continually.

20th.--My thoughts early fixed on heavenly things, with fervent desires,
that the very painful state of our society,
may lead me to attend more constantly and diligently to the vineyard of my own heart,
and to those of my precious charge.
Heard of my dear aunt E. S+++______+++`'s death.
Oh may this deeply affecting event afford to me a lastingly instructive lesson,
and prove an incitement to renewed diligence in the pursuit of that knowledge,
which alone is sufficient for us in the hour of death--the knowledge of Christ Jesus,
revealed within, the hope of glory!
In the afternoon and evening, felt much oppressed in spirit; after tea was enabled,
in some degree, to experience comfort,
by seeking refuge under the "`Rock that is higher than I.`" Retired to rest early,
feeling very much oppressed from different causes.
This day I have indeed walked through deep waters.
Oh that all my sufferings may promote my best welfare.

21st.--Rose, still feeling oppressed,
yet earnestly desiring ability to cast my burden on the Lord!
A very busy day, but my mind mercifully preserved in quietness.
The impressively important events of the past week,
will tend to mark it forcibly on memory`'s page; and oh, how fervently do I desire,
that they may be remembered to my deep and lasting instruction.
I do desire, most earnestly, to be a humble follower of Jesus; and,
however bitter the trials, which in much wisdom may be appointed me,
to wean from all undue reliance on the "`arm of flesh,`" I trust I
shall be enabled to bear them with real resignation--convinced,
while the outward may look dark before me,
and I cannot understand my heavenly Father`'s ways, that what we know not now,
we shall know hereafter.

+++[+++Her mind seemed formed for friendship,
and many of her personal attachments were very strong.
Her very frequent allusion to a much loved friend, S+++______+++, will have been remarked;
and we have yet to trace her feelings,
when it seemed meet to infinite wisdom to remove from earth this loved one,
and thus to hand a cup of bitterness to the dear subject of this memoir.
Some of the following remarks apply to another dear friend, and will show forth,
in some degree,
a feature of Mary Ann`'s character--her ability and willingness to enter
readily and feelingly into the discouragements of those dear to her.
She could indeed weep with those who wept,
while able also to rejoice with those who did rejoice.
It will be seen that she felt it necessary to place a watch
over the warmth of her feelings towards those she loved,
lest she should make idols,
and suffer regard for the creature to take the
place of the love due to the great Creator.
By the removal of several whom she had regarded with fond affection,
was she painfully but instructively reminded,
of the danger of placing her affections too much upon any
mortal--of leaning in any way upon the "`arm of flesh.`"]

[.small-break]
'''

24th.--Called, after dinner, on dearest +++_______+++, and never, I hope,
shall I forget the time passed with her.
She thought she never should feel well again on earth,
and she longed most earnestly to be prepared for, and taken to, another world;
she entreated me to take warning by her: "`Oh never, never, never, Mary Ann,
let go,`" she said, "`what thou hast--there is nothing like it,
nothing to be compared to it--I would give the world for it.`"
She said, she had been, in days past, she believed,
particularly under the notice of her heavenly Father,
but she had since been such a backslider, she hardly knew how to hope.
I reminded her of some of the gracious promises of scripture,
and she seemed a little comforted,
but said she had long been as a sheep which had gone far astray,
"`bleating on the barren mountains.`"
She begged me to take care of the first appearance of evil--even the improper thought.
"`By little and little,`" she said it was "`that we lose our hold of best good.`"
She thought even the greatest sinner would hardly go into the great unknown,
without some feeling of terror,
and she feared her present earnestness did not arise from a right
cause--but she was endeavouring to look only to the Saviour!
I reminded her of the thief on the cross.
"`Yes,`" she said, "`there was one instance of that kind, that none might despair;
and one only, that none might presume.`"
She told me, when I left her, that she should love me to the end, whenever it was,
and most affectionately took leave of me.
Oh, how earnestly do I long, that the peace of God, which passeth all understanding,
may fill her mind, and enable her to go on her way,
rejoicing in a Saviour`'s love--that whether her life be long or short,
she may be ready to obey His will.
In a lengthened life, she did so fear unfaithfulness to her master.
She said she never had known the joy, but she had experienced, in some degree,
the sweet peace of believing.

26th.--Ere I retired to rest,
my spirit was bowed in deep and fervent desire for my precious sister.
Oh, that the Shepherd of Israel may lead and support her in
all the paths He may be pleased for her to tread in.
May He shield her from every danger--keep her in the hour of temptation--
bring her safely through the wilderness of this world--and,
in the end, enable her to rejoice in Him.

[.offset]
+++[+++On the occasion of her sister`'s marriage, she writes:]

27th.--The day, though in some respects an exciting one, was such, as will long, I trust,
be remembered with gratitude, in the retrospect, to Him whose compassions fail not.
May my beloved brother and sister be strengthened,
in all the vicissitudes through which they may pass, to go faithfully on their way,
and increase more and more in the knowledge of God.

Leominster, 3mo. 4th.--"`Let him that is athirst come,
and take of the water of life freely,`" was sweetly brought to my remembrance;
and oh may I, this day, be refreshed with the water of life!
In meeting,
the occurrences of the last time I was here brought forcibly to my remembrance,
and accompanied by heartfelt gratitude.
I have since been led in paths which I knew not;
mercifully have I been brought out of many perplexities,
and enabled very frequently to see and to feel,
that it has been good for me to be afflicted;
of unnumbered blessings have I also been a very unworthy recipient.
This morning I have, renewedly and earnestly,
longed to be led forwards in the way to Zion--to be spared no
suffering calculated to promote my highest good.
The precious children!
Oh, how do I crave for them, as well as for myself, divine regard; and oh,
how do I long to be strengthened to "`go in and out before them`" in a way which
will lead them to acknowledge the excellency of the truth as it is in Jesus.
During the afternoon and evening enabled to keep on the watch tower.
Retired to rest with earnest desires to become all my heavenly Father would have me to be.

5th.--"`My presence shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.`"
This sweetly consoling promise was impressed upon my
heart during my time of retirement this morning,
when I was favoured to know a renewal of strength--being
enabled to derive encouragement from the humble hope,
that the heavenly Shepherd will guide my wandering feet in life`'s uncertain way, and,
I fervently trust, keep me near unto Him.

19th.--The last seven days I have been permitted to be a witness of a scene, which,
I trust, will ever be impressed upon my heart most deeply.
Watching by the side of my dearest +++_______+++,
I have been permitted to feel the entire insufficiency of human aid,
in the hours of suffering, to support the immortal spirit.
I have been deeply instructed in witnessing the great frailty of the human frame,
and the violent pain to which it is subjected.
I have also been taught, I trust, a lastingly instructive lesson,
on the necessity there is for the Christian to depend continually, yea, every moment,
on his God for help and guidance--without His aid we must fall, but,
supported by His everlasting arms,
the feeblest of His little ones are preserved in safety,
and carried forwards in the path of life.
In the removal of my precious friend,^
footnote:[Alluded to on the 24th of 2nd month.]
I have experienced a trial unknown to me before, the bitterness of which has been,
and is, very great.
Most earnestly do I desire, not only to bow, but to kiss the rod,
and that its severe stroke may be a fresh incitement to
me to pursue more faithfully my heavenly journey,
"`looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of my faith.`"

On the 24th, after spending days never to be forgotten,
in the "`house of mourning,`" from the renewal of earnest desires after holiness,
and from the retrospect of past days of intercourse with my beloved
friend--from the contemplation of her now forever blessed portion--
from intercourse with her bereaved family--and,
above all, from the seasons I have had of "`refreshing,
as from the presence of the Lord,`" I returned to my endeared family,
sincerely craving ability to perform my several duties rightly,
and to keep close to my heavenly Guide.
I retired to rest early, my heart covered with thankfulness to Him.

Olveston, 29th.--The quietness around me, the beautiful stillness of the country,
and above all, the mercy of my God,
tended this morning to inspire feelings of heartfelt devotion,
and desires to be kept in the "`quiet habitation.`"
Went a little walk before meeting, when I prized the opportunity of marking,
in the works of nature, the power of nature`'s God.
At night retired to rest, deeply impressed with the power and love of God,
though many of His dispensations are truly past our finding out.
Oh that I may be enabled, continually, when I cannot understand,
to trust my heavenly Father, convinced that He cannot err.
My life, I long may be as a whole burnt sacrifice to Him.
In all His works I love to mark His hand, and oh, in all my ways may I acknowledge Him.

31st.--Sweet, most sweet is it to me, to believe,
that "`the Lord is my Shepherd;`" and amidst the trials of life`'s pilgrimage,
it is consolatory and animating to know, that He is able, and willing,
if we faithfully follow Him, to preserve us from all evil.
As I returned home, in contemplating the past, and in looking forwards, my heart was,
for a short season, almost overpowered with mingled emotions,
yet mercifully and gently was I dealt with,
and I was enabled to trust my all to that gracious Being,
who has hitherto dealt with me in such unutterable love.
During the afternoon, and a rather trying evening with the children,
my mind was mercifully preserved in watchfulness;
and at night my feelings were those of heartfelt gratitude for the
help graciously vouchsafed--truly my God is indeed "`a God at hand.`"

4mo. 1st.--In a near access to the throne of grace,
I was permitted to know a portion of such sweet peace, as, for a short season,
seemed to lift me "`above this lower world.`"
Inexpressibly sweet was the thought, that more pure, more holy,
is the joy of my endeared friend, who has lately been taken from amongst us;
why should we then mourn for her departure?
Rather let us strive, with increased earnestness, to pursue our heavenly journey,
"`looking unto Jesus.`"

2nd.--In recurring to the passage,
"`Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,`" it has been comforting and animating to me,
to remember, that the sacrifices which are acceptable to Him,
are "`a broken heart and a contrite spirit,`"--these do I desire to offer in sincerity,
to Him who has dealt with me in much love.

8th.--Early this morning permitted to know a season of
refreshment as from the presence of the Lord!
The contemplation of dearest A+++______+++`'s happiness, is very precious to me,
and the knowledge that He who feeds and guides His ransomed ones by the living
fountains of waters--after having led through the river of Jordan--is graciously
pleased to support and strengthen those who are yet "`sojourners on earth.`"
The thought is unspeakably precious,
that it is the same great and good Shepherd!--the same all merciful God.

9th.--Was permitted to know near access to the throne of grace,
when I was enabled to commend my beloved parents, and brothers and sisters, together,
with all my dearly loved friends to the care of Israel`'s unslumbering Shepherd.
For my endeared mother--I have, in an especial manner, sought His guidance and support,
and I have felt comfort in committing her to His care.

14th.--"`When I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me.`"
During my short time for retirement, I fervently desired that this might be the case,
and that I might depend continually for help on my heavenly guide!

15th.--Heard of dear S. A. T+++______+++`'s death,
and again has my heart been very deeply impressed with
the necessity of being always ready.
Very sweet is the belief of her happiness;
and oh may her early removal prove an incitement to many of us to press forwards,
with fresh diligence, towards the mark for the prize of our high calling in Christ Jesus.

21st.--Fervently do I desire to have my dependence for
help fixed on the Shepherd and Bishop of our souls,
whilst gratefully sensible for all that He may see meet to send through the instrument.
Oh that I may be preserved this day from all evil, and kept at the feet of Jesus!
Attended the funeral of dear S. A. T+++______+++, for whom I have felt, during her illness,
most deeply and affectionately interested; and never shall I forget, I trust,
the (to me) very memorable day of her interment--unspeakably precious is the
thought of her eternal happiness--of her having been taught and led of the Father,
to that gracious Saviour, in whom all her hopes were placed,
at whose feet she cast all her crowns!
In standing by the beautiful remains,
the realities of the unseen world were most powerfully felt;
and during the time spent in meeting, and afterwards,
my ardent longings to be freed from "`the bondage of corruption,`"
were almost too much for the poor frail tabernacle!
I long, I pant, after the pure river of the water of life,
for I am fully persuaded none of the streams of earth can satisfy my soul.
I believe there is no sacrifice I would not render,
if I could see it the will of my heavenly Father.
I have often thought the counsel of some experienced
traveller towards Zion might be useful to me.
I desire not to lean on any human arm; and perhaps prone as I am to do so,
it is wisely ordered that I should be stripped of all outward dependence!
My help must be, and oh may it be, continually from the Lord,
and if he sees meet to permit an instrument to aid in His purposes concerning me,
He will, I can at this season confidently believe, make clear a way for it to be so.

5mo. 4th.--Speaking quickly to one of the children,
prevented my having that comfort in my time of retirement, which I ever long after.
Made sensible of my sin, and was enabled to confess it unto God;
and I sought His guidance for my erring feet during the day.
In the afternoon yielded to a temptation, which afterwards cost me much suffering,
and which I have in sincerity craved ability from above to withstand in future.
Care for the poor body,
I still continually prove to be one of the fleshly lusts which war against the soul,
and I have at my Saviour`'s feet,
sought ability to overcome it--and oh may I more
continually feel the necessity of doing so.
Passed a satisfactory evening with my dear mother and the little
children--mercifully strengthened whilst with the latter;
and enabled, in a short time of retirement, to cast my burdens on the Lord.

16th.--In the afternoon, recurred, with deep interest, to the steps of the last week,
most of them have been taken under a painful
sense of the frailty of all human dependence,
and yet under a feeling of inability to trust myself
wholly to the strength of the everlasting arm.
My way has been truly a heavy one, and I have gone on from day to day weary,
and at seasons almost overwhelmed from great oppression; this has been, I believe,
and I rejoice in believing, greatly increased by the state of my poor body,
although I must mourn over a want of greater watchfulness,
of more full devotedness of heart.
This evening I feel more refreshed in body than I have done for some time--
thankfulness on this account is accompanied by fervent cravings of spirit
after ability to become all my heavenly Father would have me to be!
I know, I am renewedly sensible,
that nothing on earth can satisfy the longings of my soul! and every prop,
on which my poor weak nature would lead me to lean improperly,
I earnestly desire may be broken, and that I may thus lean on the mighty for strength,
and on the Rock of Ages for a never failing refuge.

18th.--"`For we are made partakers of Christ,
if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end.`"
This sweet passage was forcibly brought to my remembrance on first waking this morning,
accompanied with earnest desires to be strengthened to hold
the beginning of my confidence steadfast unto the end of life.
My spirit earnestly panted after "`living water,`" and I was
enabled to look on all the trials of this changing scene,
as not worthy to be compared to the glory to be revealed in us!
Oh may it be more and more my blessed privilege to be led by the Spirit of God,
and thus experience the fulfilment of the gracious language,
"`for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.`"

5mo. 31st.--Very early this month, deeply impressed with my many wants,
I was strengthened at the footstool of divine grace, to seek help for all my need;
and the gracious promise was impressively and sweetly brought to my remembrance,
"`I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment; lest any hurt it,
I will keep it night and day.`"
This precious language was permitted to afford me comfort and encouragement in meeting,
when my heart was bowed down in earnest longing after
fresh and constant supplies of pure and living water,
whereby I may be refreshed and strengthened to pursue, with greater diligence,
the things which belong to my everlasting peace.
Again dwelt, with deep interest,
on the blessedness of those who are early made inhabitants of Zion; whilst for myself,
the craving of my soul, I desired more constantly might be,
that my heavenly Father`'s will may be done!

6mo. 8th.--Earnestly desired, in my short time of retirement,
to be kept in quietness this day, by my gracious Guide.
Sweet is the knowledge that He remembereth that we are but dust,
and that my many infirmities are regarded by Him with infinite compassion,
long suffering, paternal love.

13th.--The prayer of my soul this morning has been,
"`Be thou my strong habitation whereunto I may continually resort.`"
I was strengthened, gratefully to receive extreme suffering for a short time,
only desiring that the divine will concerning me might be fully accomplished.
Although feeling much oppressed, my mind was, during the morning, preserved in quietness.
In the evening felt a little relieved,
and I was graciously permitted to know sweet access unto the footstool of divine mercy,
and there to pour forth the breathings of my heart to Him who
does so very mercifully and tenderly care for His unworthy
child! visiting her transgressions with the rod,
and permitting her to know, when walking in the path of obedience,
seasons of refreshment from His presence.
"`Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy name.`"

14th.--I earnestly desired ability to keep this day in the quiet habitation,
and that all the events of it may be blessed to my soul.
Not feeling well enough to go to meeting, I remained at home,
where the time has passed rapidly away.
In outward stillness I have been strengthened to seek a renewal of strength,
and I have been permitted sweet union of spirit with many of my beloved friends,
for whom, and for myself,
I have this morning earnestly desired divine guidance and support.
I have dwelt on the privileges of Christian friendship,
and I have rejoiced in remembering that we have the highest authority
for its promotion in our passage through the wilderness.
When about to be taken from His followers,
the disciple "`whom Jesus loved`" was permitted, by His divine Master,
to recline on His bosom.
What tender compassion did He ever evince for the weakness of His creatures,
and how sweet is it to believe He still regards His
unworthy little ones with unbounded love and mercy.

26th.--My twenty-second birthday!
The language of my heart, on rising this morning, was,
"`Oh send forth thy light and thy truth and let them lead me!`"
And ere I joined the circle below stairs, in a short time of outward stillness,
my soul was bowed with earnest desires at the footstool of divine mercy,
deeply feeling my many backslidings--my very great
unworthiness--yet craving the support of the everlasting arm,
for the remainder of my pilgrimage; and, through the mercy of my compassionate Saviour,
to know a preservation from evil as long as I am in the world!
Unable to go to meeting,
I passed an hour alone--and have been made renewedly sensible of the
mercy of the Lord.. His arm of love has been extended for my support,
whilst treading, in the last twelve months, in paths which I had not known;
and yet my feet have again and again wandered from His way!
I long earnestly that my transgressions may continue to be visited with the rod,
and my iniquity with stripes.
I long, I earnestly pant, after living water--my soul, at seasons,
has been bowed in earnest cravings after heavenly good;
and I do at this time desire afresh to dedicate my all to Him, to whom it all belongs.

The temptations which surround, have latterly, led me, I fear,
to dwell with too much earnestness on the blessedness
of those who are removed beyond the reach of these;
or, rather,
I have myself longed too earnestly to depart--convinced
that this has been a temptation of the enemy,
preventing, as it has done, my attending to present duties,
I have sought strength from above to resist it,
and to be enabled fully to adopt the apostle`'s language, "`To me, to live is Christ,
and to die is gain.`"
And though to me to die would, I humbly trust, be infinite and eternal gain, yet, also,
to live is Christ--and oh, may my will be made more conformable to His.

7mo. 3rd.--During the day was rather excited,
by a proposition to go to +++_______+++ immediately;
and I did wrong in thinking of outward reasons for doing so,
instead of taking counsel directly from the Lord.
In the afternoon,
I earnestly craved of Him ability to do His will--and very mercifully did He
condescend to afford more of a calm in the conclusion I came to,
than I had dared to anticipate, from not having immediately gone to Him.

9th.--Although "`rejoicing`" in the love of my heavenly Father was not,
in my time of quietness, permitted to be mine,
and although a dark cloud seemed still to cover my mental horizon,
yet was I enabled to trust in the Lord, and, in some degree, to stay myself upon my God,
whilst earnestly craving of Him ability faithfully to pursue my way this day--to be
preserved from doing any thing that would dishonour Him.

Leominster, 11th.--Called on dear +++_______+++, and had a little pleasant intercourse with her.
How do I hope that all such will be blessed to my soul.
Very unworthy of her love and interest, as well as of that of all my beloved friends,
and deeply humbled, I trust,
from the knowledge that it must proceed from their love to that gracious Master,
who has so mercifully and tenderly cared for me.

13th.--Again met my precious S+++______+++, and had a little intercourse with her.
With real concern I watched the marks of indisposition on her countenance.
My spirit felt quite oppressed with fear for this tenderly loved one;
and very sincerely did I desire ability to
commend her to the care of her heavenly Father.
Oh that He may be graciously pleased to carry on and perfect
the work in her soul--to make her complete in Christ Jesus.
And may the manner in which I have borne even the
contemplation of resigning my dearest friend,
convey a lesson of deep instruction to my own mind,
and lead me more earnestly to contend "`for the faith once delivered to the saints.`"

17th.--Woke very early,
and with earnestness desired divine preservation--
craving ability to walk in humility and watchfulness,
and to know the thoughts brought more entirely
into subjection to the obedience of Christ.
For my dear +++_______+++, I have desired the best of blessings.
During the morning, +++_______+++ called,
and most kindly expressed her desires on my behalf--I long that they may be realized.
In the afternoon, had a pleasant ride with my valued friends to +++______+++.
18th.--This morning my heart was bowed with earnest desires to go faithfully on my way.

26th.-- Rose with earnest desire that the bread this day dispensed amongst us,
may be especially blessed to my dearest S+++______+++. For her, dining the past week,
I have indeed been introduced into the baptism of suffering.
During the morning meeting, I walked in a barren way, but after some time,
my heart was filled with living desires,
that the food so graciously permitted to be handed to us, by a devoted follower of Jesus,
might be blessed to me and all my friends.

The contemplation of my own path, my many mercies, etc., so completely overpowered me,
that, for some time, I felt it a comfort to be alone,
to pour out my soul at the feet of my Saviour, and to crave preservation of Him,
for my wandering footsteps, in those paths in the wilderness, which, at times,
appear so crowded with dangers and difficulties,
as to make me shrink from walking in them.
But, oh, may I more constantly bear in mind, the strength of my Guide,
and the help He has promised to those who seek it of Him.
Permitted, in the evening, richly to partake of sweetly sustaining peace.

8mo. 4th.--Today I am to part from my dearest S+++______+++ and my other valued friends here.
Oh that I may be kept on the watch tower--deeply convinced of the necessity of being so.
Came to Leominster.
My heart was, in the evening, almost overpowered with gratitude to my heavenly Father,
for the many undeserved and countless mercies He has showered on me.
Ere I retired to rest, enabled, in some degree,
to commit my tenderly loved S+++______+++ to His care, with all my other friends,
and to crave for myself ability to walk more constantly "`in the newness of life.`"

8th.--Oh thou, who hast, in infinite and tender compassion, led me thus far, be pleased,
I pray thee, for the sake of thy beloved Son, to be near me still,
and keep me close to thee!
Suffer me not to wander from thy ways, but keep me, in deep humility,
more constantly at thy footstool!
Thou knowest my wanderings; and, oh, be graciously pleased, again and again,
to turn thine hand upon me, to take away my dross.

[verse]
____
"`Whate`'er thy power has shaken, shake again,
Till nought but things immoveable remain!`"
____

9th.--Heard of B. G+++______+++`'s removal, and my heart was bowed, during meeting,
in sympathy with his beloved wife and family.
At this time they expected to be on a journey in North Wales!
How striking is the lesson which ought to be conveyed
by his unexpected removal to the heavenly Canaan!
Oh that it may prove one to many of us,
which may long be remembered to our lasting instruction!
My wayward heart!
Ever prone to wander from thee, oh do thou, my heavenly Father, lend a pitying ear,
and stoop to succour thy unworthy child from the snares of the enemy.

10th.--A portion of unearthly peace permitted, during the morning, to be mine,
for which gratitude has been the covering of my spirit.
In green pastures have I been permitted to walk;
and whilst I allow the fear of the enemy too often to discourage me,
the sense of the power of the great and good Shepherd has, at this time,
sweetly prevailed over every other feeling.
To be strengthened to glorify God, even though it be in the fire,
has been the very earnest desire of my soul.

13th.--I have this morning been looking at a
little account of my endeared sister and myself,
written nearly twelve years ago; and now,
whilst the feeling is fresh and present with me, I would again acknowledge,
with gratitude, the goodness of my heavenly Shepherd,
who then first manifested Himself to me; and, how wonderfully, how very mercifully,
has He since condescended to lead me in safe paths.
With no human counsellor, exposed to more than common danger,
His gracious arm was near to protect--in the years which followed my
first visitation--that unworthy little one who wandered,
sadly wandered, from His way!
Yet the drawings of His love continued, at seasons, to be experienced.
I felt the importance of a life of simple obedience.
I longed to be, at seasons, fervently longed to be, one of the good Shepherd`'s lambs.
But not until bowed down by illness,
not until brought as into the valley of the shadow of death,
was I sufficiently sensible of the love of my Saviour,
and strengthened by Him to yield my heart a willing sacrifice to the Father of mercies!
Then was He pleased,
in condescending lovingkindness to make my way "`plain before my face.`"
And though I have, again and again, broken His commandments,
refused to listen to His gracious voice, He has not left me--but, in love unutterable,
visited my transgressions with the rod, and led me back from my wanderings,
to His own green pastures.
Gracious Father, enable me,
through the "`Captain of our salvation,`" now to
stand a faithful soldier on the field of battle.
Do thou point out to me the arrows of the enemy; and be thou graciously pleased,
for the sake of thy beloved Son, to cover my head.

20th.--The fervent desire of my heart, in my time of retirement, was,
to be made really humble.
Strange does it appear that I should ever indulge the thought,
that I have been made of use to others.
Oh gracious Father, for the sake of thy beloved Son, show me my weakness,
humble me under a sense of it; yet withdraw not, I pray thee,
the precious sense of the sufficiency of thy power.
In thy strength make thou me strong;
only make me deeply sensible that it is thy strength--thy omnipotent
arm which is stretched out for succour and support--thy arm,
which is "`mighty to save!`"
Enable me to lean upon it this day.
Do thou be graciously pleased to enable me to write to my beloved mother what may,
under thy blessing, be useful to her--calm her, comfort her, if this be thy holy will.
But if it be best for me that my hand should not
administer to her the cup of consolation,
do thou, O gracious God, for my Saviour`'s sake, hand it to her, and enable her to see,
in whatever portion thou thinkest best for her,
that much mercy is mixed with it! "`Thy will, not ours, be done.`"

9mo. 7th.--Enabled to get on satisfactorily on my journey to
G+++______+++. For my beloved relations whom I have left,
the prayer of my soul ascended to my heavenly Father.
Do thou, O gracious God, be pleased, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to look down upon them, and bless them with thy choicest blessing!
Enable those who have entered into covenant with thee to go forwards,
and in thy strength subdue all their enemies.
And oh look down upon those who have, at seasons,
fervently desired to serve thee--who have suffered the things
of time to have too much place in their affections--lead them,
I humbly pray thee, to green pastures, and permit them to taste of that water,
of which whosoever drinketh shall thirst no more forever!

10th.--I rose with earnest desires to be preserved in faithfulness.
In all probability, I shall this evening reach my beloved home,
and in my time of retirement,
my spirit was bowed with fervent desires for ability rightly
to perform the many duties devolving on me there.
My whole soul at this time pants after God, and oh that I may be permitted,
through constant faithfulness, to receive more and more of His fulness.

After leaving G+++______+++, sweet peace was permitted to be my portion;
and as I drew near home,
indescribable were the feelings of gratitude which filled my heart.
Received a warm welcome from my beloved family.
My spirit was bowed in earnest supplication at the throne of grace,
for ability to live entirely to Him who died for me, and rose again.
I retired to rest under a most deep and precious sense of His love.

16th.--Tomorrow we shall, in all probability,
leave forever a spot where we have received many unmerited blessings,
and I can at this moment, through divine assistance, contemplate doing so,
with the chief desire of my heart being,
that every change may be blessed to me--that every step may bring me nearer to God.
Oh I do long for ability to live close unto Him.

21st.--Had an interview with dear +++_______+++, when I was strengthened to speak to him freely.
Very much do I desire the best welfare of this dear brother, and for him,
and all the other members of our family,
may my spirit never shrink from exercise! but oh
may my hands be strengthened to strengthen them.

22nd +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ took tea with us.
The former, in allusion to the present state of things in our society, said,
he thought our only place of safety was,
in keeping near to Him who is the "`healer of
the breach--the restorer of paths to dwell in.`"
Very earnestly have I longed,
that this may be my situation--that I may be permitted to go to the depths of Jordan,
if from thence I shall bring the largest stones of memorial.

26th.--Rose with very earnest desires to be preserved in faithfulness.
After a fatiguing day, during which my body was often overcome with weariness,
I much prized some time of quietness,
when I was bowed in the recollection of the mercies of the past week--under
a deep sense of the continued lovingkindness of my heavenly Father,
and very earnest desires to be His more entirely, His forever!
In the smallest dispensations of His love, may I be enabled to trace His hand;
and may my body, soul,
and spirit be His to the close of life--may I indeed "`be strong in the faith.`"
My poor weak nature too often shrinks from suffering, yet there are moments when I can,
and do, in sincerity, desire, that the scourge of divine judgment may be laid upon me,
if I refuse to yield obedience to the manifestations of the Spirit of Jesus--
if I refuse to follow Him in every path He may be pleased for me to walk in.
How wonderful is His love, in going before His own sheep!
Why need we, with such a leader, fear the approach of the enemy,
even in sheep`'s clothing?
Gracious Father, for His sake, who has borne our sins in His own body on the tree,
be pleased to look down upon thy poor frail child,
and enable Her more fully to trust in thee!

10mo. 2nd.--"`He will be very gracious unto thee, at the voice of thy cry;
when He shall hear it, He will answer thee.`"
This sweetly consolatory language was, when I first woke, deeply impressed upon my heart,
and under a renewed and precious sense of His faithfulness who has promised,
I was enabled to approach the throne of grace,
craving ability to keep near unto Him--this is all I desire,
for if preserved there I know that all must be well.
Oh, that on the precious children, the divine blessing may rest this day.
At night, in recurring to the past day,
my heart was covered with thankfulness for the
help which has been mercifully afforded me.
Oh, I have indeed cause to "`trust and not be afraid.`"
I am feeling unusually well to-night; for this favour I desire to be truly thankful.

12th.--A cup of bitterness has been permitted to be my portion.
My much loved and valued aunt P. S+++______+++ has been removed from this uncertain world.
She who first taught me the necessity of coming to the Saviour--of being "`born
again,`"--has been removed from this scene of trial and temptation;
and my heart has not bowed with that submission, to the chastening stroke,
it ought to have done.
I have been too much inclined to murmur.
O gracious Father, enable me, for my Saviour`'s sake, to kiss the rod--to say,
"`Thy will be done!`"
For my beloved uncle I would crave thy support--be near, strengthen, succour him;
and to the precious children, be thou a father and a friend, a guide and counsellor,
for His sake who has done all for us!

Leominster, 15th.--The beloved, the tenderly endeared friend of my childhood,
who first taught me the worth of my immortal soul, and led me to the feet of the Saviour,
is now unable any more to watch over my footsteps, to smooth my way; but on her behalf,
I rejoice, that by her the voice of the tempter shall never more be heard,
and I do most earnestly crave, at this time,
renewed ability to live near unto Jesus--to follow Him
in every step He may be pleased that I should take.
And oh I would crave for all the bereaved ones,
fresh strength to go forward in the heavenly race.
May those who are yet afar off be enabled to
acknowledge that they have seen the work of the Lord,
and those who are already near Him, acknowledge His might!

17th.--I recurred with deep interest to the events of the past week,
and with very fervent desires craved ability to profit by them,
whilst I could more readily comprehend the language of
the Psalmist than I had hitherto done--"`I was dumb,
I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.`"
Convinced that my dear aunt has been taken in much mercy, my chief desire now is,
that we who have walked with her in the wilderness,
may profit as we ought by her removal from us.

31st.--I have seen afresh that the way for the ransomed of the Lord to walk in,
is through the "`depths of the sea;`" and I have been renewedly
brought to feel that it is good for me to be afflicted.
Therefore would I continue to desire, that the hand of my heavenly Father may not spare,
nor His eye pity, until His work in my soul be fully accomplished!
And day by day, O gracious Father, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
enable me to take straight steps; preserve me from falling into the miry clay;
set thou my feet on the rock, and establish my goings!
Oh be thou pleased, day by day, to go before me,
and be thou my reward!--that whether my journey be short or long,
thou mayest be glorified,
by manifesting thy power in and towards one of the feeblest of thy little ones.

11mo. 6th.--Suffered loss from allowing writing to prevent my going, at the exact time,
for my retirement.
I find it is indeed true, that stated time is a hedge of duty;
even putting it off a few minutes, when it is not absolutely necessary,
is quite injurious to me.
I am so very frail, I need constant supplies of strength,
and I find silent waiting for it a precious means of obtaining it.

7th.--A subject of deep importance was this morning placed before me,
by my dear uncle S+++______+++ +++[+++a proposal to remain in his family, to which she consented]
and I have endeavoured to seek, with singleness of purpose,
directions from on high respecting it.
Whilst doing so, I was mercifully cheered, by the sweet promises of scripture,
and enabled to commit my way entirely unto Him,
trusting that He will not permit me to take one step without His protecting care!
A sweet sense of divine love refreshed my soul in the evening.
Oh how precious is the lovingkindness of the Lord!

17th.--My heart was bowed in desire to be strengthened
to do only my heavenly Father`'s will.
In my time of retirement, during the morning,
was permitted to feel more comfort in looking for direction unto the Lord!
Told my uncle the desires I have respecting my future way,
and more comfort has attended it than I could have hoped for.
Still I earnestly desire that the divine will alone may be accomplished.

21st.--In recurring to the past week,
sincere thankfulness I feel should be the covering of my spirit--that
although deeply "`cast down,`" I have not been destroyed--that some
seasons of strength and refreshment have been permitted me,
even when my heart has been almost overwhelmed within me; and now,
that another week is drawing to a close, I would still remember the Lord`'s mercy,
and crave of Him ability to give myself up more entirely to Him.
"`Feed me with the food convenient for me,`" is still the language of my soul,
even though, at seasons, I shrink,
from believing that this will be the "`bread of adversity and the water of affliction.`"
In the evening, whilst reading in the Memoir of E. Payson,
my heart was filled with desire to be devoted, as he was,
to my heavenly Father`'s service.
Oh how do I long that sin may be destroyed, that I may not henceforth serve sin,
but that I may experience my heart to be a temple of the Holy Ghost;
and from a vivid sense of the precious truth that I am not my own, be enabled,
constantly to seek ability to glorify God, in my body and in my spirit, which are God`'s.

22nd.--Be thou very near me, was, in a few minutes`' stillness, the language of my heart.
After breakfast, and meeting,
the agony of prayer can only describe my mental state--a craving for
divine preservation for my beloved family and friends,
and especially for my own soul, and indescribable longings after holiness,
were almost too much for the poor frail tabernacle.
Turn thine hand upon me, and purely take away all my dross, and all my tin,
for the sake of my compassionate Saviour, was the fervent petition of my soul,
for truly never can I be satisfied until I awake with thy likeness!
Oh the burden, the almost overwhelming burden of sin!
Never, I think, have I more deeply felt my own weakness, my own utter unworthiness,
than this morning;
yet I long to have a more constant sense of it--I long that "`the
power of Christ`" may more constantly rest upon me--that He may be
all in all--whilst I am bowed under a sense,
yea made deeply sensible that I am nothing!

23rd.--In dwelling on my great unworthiness, my continual slidings from His ways, I have,
this evening, craved of Him ability to walk more closely with Him,
to endeavour to obey the Apostolic injunction fully, "`whether therefore ye eat or drink,
or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.`"
I long to help my fellow pilgrims--to point the Saviour out to those who know Him not.
Yet, gracious Father,
if ever it be thy will to bestow such a privilege on thy unworthy child,
I feel so sure of the necessity of deep suffering to keep me humble,
that I hardly dare ask it--"`Thy will be done!`"--and
may I ever remember that "`Thine alone is the power!`"

24th.--Gracious and ever merciful Father, I would ask of thee,
for the sake of thy beloved Son to do with me as it seemeth good in thy sight,
only bring and keep me very near unto thyself--that only seeing in thy light,
only walking in thy might, I may be enabled to glorify thee by my life and death.
In the evening was strengthened to commit my way unto the Lord,
earnestly craving His continued guidance and support.
It appears to me that it would little signify the heat of the
furnace he may deem necessary for his children`'s purification,
if, in His condescending mercy, He is but pleased to be with them in it.
"`To suffer with Christ,`" at this moment, appears a privilege, I would,
and do most ardently desire.
A little bodily suffering was permitted me before I went to bed,
for which I felt thankful.

29th.--A poor account of my dearest S+++______+++ has
awakened my warmest solicitude on her account,
but I endeavoured in a short time of stillness, to commit her unto the Lord,
earnestly desiring for her the light of His countenance.
O that I may be preserved from anxiety about this dearly loved friend,
and be enabled to derive comfort from the knowledge
that she is in the hands of the Most Merciful.
And shall not the Judge of the whole earth do right?
May every repining thought then be hushed,
and may I seek entire submission to the divine will.
The trial which I dread may perhaps be the needed one for me.
Strengthen me, gracious God, for my Saviour`'s sake, to bear it as I ought!
In the afternoon able to commit all my beloved friends to God, with my own soul,
only desiring that His will may be done.
In the evening permitted to enjoy a season of refreshment,
as from the presence of the Lord.
Enabled to commit all dear to me to His tender care,
and strengthened to pray for the advancement of His work of righteousness in my own soul.

12mo. 2nd.--"`The Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed,
a refuge in time of trouble;`" and let those who love thy name put their trust in thee.
Whilst this language has been sweetly and impressively brought to my remembrance,
I have this morning earnestly desired more fully
to be enabled to trust my all unto the Lord.
I have, for some time, thought I ought to know a little more of the servants,
and I desired to be directed rightly how to do so.
This evening I was strengthened to have a little satisfactory
conversation with E+++______+++. Oh that towards her,
and the others, I may be enabled to discharge the duty now devolving on me;
but may I ever bear in mind my own great frailty,
and be kept very low at my Saviour`'s feet.

6th.--Earnestly craved ability, in a short time of retirement,
both to will and to do the Lord`'s good pleasure.
Suffered in meeting, from allowing my strong attachments to some dearly loved friends,
to prevent my spending the time there as I ought,
in worshipping Him whom I at times deeply feel I love, love supremely.
Oh, thou, who oughtest to have the first place in my affections,
I pray thee for my Saviour`'s sake, to enable me always to acknowledge, with sincerity,
that thou hast,
and oh be pleased to strengthen me to love thy children "`with a pure heart,
fervently,`" yet not suffer any to take the
place which thou alone shouldst have in my heart.
Ere the close of the afternoon heard another poor account of
my dearest S+++______+++. I have not been disposed to murmur,
but my spirit has trembled at the prospect which has afresh opened to me.
Oh that the arm of divine, of everlasting love may be underneath her;
and may I experience also its supporting power.
Enabled in some degree, to commend this most precious friend, with all dear to me,
unto the Lord!
Went to sleep,
earnestly desiring that my precious S+++______+++`'s
precarious state may be blessed to my soul.

7th.--My heart was deeply bowed in the contemplation of resigning forever,
in this world, my much loved S+++______+++. Gracious God! enable me to do as I ought,
if it be thy will to take her to thyself.
But do thou be very near her, and thy very unworthy child,
who now craves this blessing for her Saviour`'s sake.
This has been a day ever to be remembered--the threatened bereavement has, at times,
completely overpowered me.
I have not murmured, being mercifully preserved from doing so,
but I have felt deeply afflicted; still, in my moments of severest suffering,
I have been enabled to desire that all things may work together for my good,
whilst for that beloved, that precious friend,
who appears on the verge of the eternal world--perhaps already entered on her
heavenly inheritance--I have earnestly desired the support of the everlasting arms.
Permitted to feel, in some degree,
strengthened by approaching the throne of grace on her, and my own behalf in the evening.

[.small-break]
'''

+++[+++The apprehensions thus expressed were confirmed,
and she was now called upon to resign her dearest earthly friend.
Her feelings, while thus bowed, as to the dust, under the afflictive dispensation,
are expressed in several of her letters as well as in the following memoranda.]

[.small-break]
'''

9th.--The feelings of deep sorrow which filled my heart on retiring to rest,
are this morning accompanied with sweet confidence in my heavenly Father.
And "`though He slay me,
yet will I trust in Him,`" was a passage forcibly recalled to my remembrance,
almost immediately after waking,
and I was strengthened to adopt it as the present language of my heart.
I must say present, for alas,
often has even the expected storm threatened to overwhelm me;
my only trust is in the support of the arm of power.--A letter from
my aunt has conveyed to me the solemn and affecting intelligence,
that my much loved friend is no more.
Still mercifully am I preserved from murmuring,
but the bitterness of my sorrow is known only to Him who has
been pleased to take my precious S+++______+++ unto Himself!

Dearly beloved one! thou who hast for years entered
with the tenderest sympathy into my every trial,
thou who hast partaken my every joy, art forever removed from my eyes in this world;
but thou art sheltered from the storms of the wilderness,
in one of the heavenly mansions; thou art, I cannot doubt, a blessed inhabitant of Zion,
and I trust I may be strengthened to rejoice in thy everlasting glory!
And for myself, I do ardently crave that this bitter trial may be sanctified,
and that I may become more entirely devoted unto the Lord.
Preserved during the day from repining, though deeply bowed down.
In a time of stillness, in the evening, I was strengthened to recur to the past,
ever memorable, and deeply impressive, twelve hours.
I have craved of my heavenly Father, if needful for my purification,
to be permitted to pass through the furnace "`heated seven times,`" and I
would desire to consider it a proof of His continued and unmerited love,
that such has been the case, but especially that my Saviour has been with me there;
and ere this day closes, I would crave, with earnestness,
ability to go forwards in my heavenly race--to know this deep affliction
sweetly sanctified--to seek unceasingly to have my thoughts fixed on things
eternal--brought entirely into subjection to the obedience of Christ.
Surely I am called to perfect dedication.

Oh gracious and ever merciful Father, point out to me what I am withholding,
and strengthen me to give up all--every desire!
Oh make me fully meet for the inheritance of the saints in light!
I have thought of going to the interment of my dearest S+++______+++,
if it be wrong for me to do so, may it be made clearly manifest; and oh,
if I am permitted to go, may the time be blessed to my soul!
Awake for several hours in the night,
when I had a most vivid sense of my heavy trial--suffering comparable only
to "`slaying,`"--yet confidence in divine mercy did not forsake me,
but continued to prevail in my heart.

10th.--My heart, during the morning, was bowed down, but I was not forsaken;
my heavenly Father`'s love supported and even comforted me.
In the afternoon a sweet sense of my precious S+++______+++`'s happiness was permitted me,
and I felt renewedly called on to press forwards in the road to Zion--
but an overpowering sense of my deep affliction followed!
Perhaps we may not be long divided--oh that whether long or
short the remaining time may be improved as it ought!
In the evening my "`bleeding heart`" was soothed by the precious conviction,
that if fully and rightly occupied, "`time flies apace!`"

Oh gracious God, enable me, for my Saviour`'s sake, henceforth to live only unto thee!
May the remembrance of the path trodden with her,
whom I do rejoice is forever with thee, be lastingly blessed.
I would "`crave a portion of her spirit--of her
deep humility--of her forgetfulness of self.
And oh, for her bereaved family I would ask thy blessing.
But whilst to others I feel the present dispensation of thy love to be a call of mercy,
to me, thy unworthy little one, I do believe it is, in an especial manner,
a loud command to keep myself from idols--to give myself up unreservedly to thee.
Enable me, I humbly pray thee, to obey this command, and to yield myself up,
through our all-sufficient intercessor with thee, a whole burnt sacrifice.

13th.--Today, all that is mortal of my precious friend will be consigned to the grave.
In an intensely interesting season in the evening,
I did fervently crave that the present dispensation may be lastingly blessed,
not only to myself, but to many of those to whom my precious S+++______+++ was closely bound.
Gracious and ever merciful God! thou only knowest the darkness of the
cloud which this visitation of thy love has cast around the paths of
some of us--thou only knowest the bitterness of our cups,
and I would fervently entreat of thee, for the sake of our adorable Redeemer,
not to let the cloud, or even the darkness of it, pass away,
without permitting thy blessing to descend upon us;
enable us to feel that thou hast visited us in love--that in
infinite mercy thou hast been pleased to gather our dearly
beloved one into thy fold of everlasting safety.
But we are still in the wilderness.
Thou knowest the dreariness of our way--thou knowest the
trials and temptations to which we are still exposed;
permit, I pray thee, thy word to be a light unto our paths, a lamp unto our feet!
Keep us near unto thee,
that when thou art pleased to call us hence we may be
prepared to give an account of our stewardship!
Before retiring to rest I was enabled to raise a tribute of thankfulness to God,
whilst earnestly desiring of Him help to become His only forever.

22nd.--Rose with fervent desires after ability to go safely on my way, looking unto Jesus!
A quiet morning--my mind was bowed under a sense of my great loss,
but I was enabled to feel quiet confidence in my heavenly Father,
and felt strengthened during a short time of retirement.
I have felt this day unable to take an active part in the passing scene,
yet I have mercifully been preserved in quietness, and feel cause to be very thankful,
in recurring to the past, to the Author of all my mercies!
How rich, how boundless is His mercy!

31st.--In the evening recurred to the ever memorable events of
the past year--to the steps I have taken in it--and my heart
has been almost overpowered with mingled feelings.
I have been permitted to walk as through the depths of the sea; and yet, in infinite,
in boundless mercy, my compassionate Saviour has there sustained me with His presence,
and comforted me with His love.
Three of my dearest friends have been removed from this changing scene,
to (I cannot doubt) the heavenly Jerusalem; and whilst my heart still bleeds,
from the severing stroke, I would, on their account,
desire to raise the tribute of gratitude and praise!
Unnumbered blessings have marked my path during the last twelve months.
For the first time,
I have witnessed the "`putting off of mortality,`" and in that
solemn moment have deeply felt the preciousness of the hope
which maketh not ashamed--"`repentance towards God,
and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.`"
The remembrance of many, many shortcomings, ought deeply to humble me,
whilst the hope of having made a few straight steps,
would lead me to "`thank God and take courage.`"
Convinced that He alone can strengthen His children to perform His holy will, I would,
at this time, earnestly crave of Him ability to go forwards,
to follow closely the great Captain of my salvation--clothed with His holy armour,
and knowing my head to be covered by Him in the day of battle!

1836, 1mo. 1st.--The first day of another year,
I have desired to commence with renewing my covenant with the Lord;
with seeking help from Him to keep that covenant,
to become more unreservedly given up to His service, to resign my own will entirely,
and to walk only in His light!
Enable me, O gracious God, for the sake of my adorable Redeemer,
whilst humbled under a deep sense of thy power, to seek, daily and hourly,
help from thee, to press forwards, leaving the things which are behind!
Strengthen me to "`follow on`" to know thee.
Make me "`complete in Christ,`" being clothed with His righteousness.
Thou hast been pleased, in the last year, by the dispensations of thy love,
to call loudly upon me to arise, and go forwards.
Thou hast, in mercy, deeply afflicted me;
thou hast broken some of my strongest earthly ties; and now,
I would desire to seek my all in thee!--but thou knowest "`the flesh
is weak;`" and under a lively sense of my many infirmities,
I would crave of thee ability not only to will, but to do thy good pleasure.
Suffer me not to wander far from thee; but,
when disposed to yield to the temptations of the enemy,
do thou still visit my "`transgressions with the rod, and my iniquities with stripes.`"
With intense desire do I now long after entire conformity to thy will,
and though still feeling the heat of the furnace
thou hast been pleased for me to pass through,
I would ask thee to do with me as seemeth good in thy sight--only
strengthen me to yield to the influences of thy Holy Spirit,
and thus to become a vessel fitted for thy use.
Uncertainty clouds the future, and I dare not look forwards;
but should life be spared another year,
do thou permit me to witness advancement in thy ways--a going from stature to stature!

11th.--In the afternoon desired, for all my friends, and for my own soul,
strength and refreshment from the everlasting Fountain!
The path of holiness appeared this evening unspeakably beautiful,
and with renewed and earnest longings have I craved ability to take straight
steps in it--my eye fixed on Him who graciously assured His disciples,
that He goeth before his own sheep.
Oh wonderful love! boundless compassion!
May I then, as one of the least of His lambs, find shelter under His protecting care,
from the cruel enemy.

12th.--In a time of retirement,
this morning my heart was filled with ardent desire for
the advancement of Christ`'s kingdom on earth.
In the afternoon earnestly sought the divine blessing for all my beloved ones,
but especially for my dear mother;
very fervently have I craved the completion of the work of grace in her soul.
My thoughts, this evening, have turned towards my beloved home,
with feeling of very affectionate solicitude--I
was strengthened afresh to commit all these,
with my own soul, my heavenly Father,
yet craving that the spirit of prayer may more constantly
prevail in my heart--that I may "`pray always.`"

17th.--Almost overpowering feelings of desire for the
glory of God filled my heart before retiring to rest;
my soul was ready to magnify the Lord, my spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour.
After this precious season, should my heavenly Father see meet to try me,
how do I desire of Him strength for all my need.

2mo. 3rd.--Left Leominster in the evening,
and after a peaceful journey was favoured to reach home safely on the 4th,
where gratitude filled my heart,
accompanied by ardent desire to be preserved in
faithfulness to my divine Master during my stay here.

17th.--Was strengthened to feel resigned, in a much greater degree, to the divine will,
respecting my health, and enabled to commit my all more entirely to the Lord.
In the retrospect of this day, I have, I trust,
been humbled with the renewed conviction of being an unprofitable servant!
My mind has so much participated in the oppression of the poor body,
that very often I have felt unable to use any mental exertion.
The lifting up of the eye to heaven, and adopting the language of the poor publican,
"`God be merciful to me a sinner,`" I have felt the needful and best exercise for me.

26th.--Oh that the last three weeks may long be instructively remembered by me.
Afresh taught my very great unworthiness, I long, at this moment,
more fully to prove "`the sufficiency of Christ!`"
His abundant mercy has been daily manifested toward me, whilst walking as in a weary land.
Now I contemplate, for the benefit of the poor body, a voyage to Swansea,
the effect of it only known to God! and of Him I would crave ability to say,
in sincerity, "`Thy will be done.`"
Whether permitted still to feel oppressed and weary,
or favoured with the blessing of health,
only do I long that every moment may be more entirely given up to the work of the Lord.

27th.--Oh how do I desire that my natural will may be entirely subjected; that I may,
in my daily walk, prove that I have been "`created anew in Christ Jesus.`"

28th.--Very earnestly longed that the hand of
divine love may still be stretched towards me,
whether it be to administer the cup of consolation, or that of affliction.
If it be the latter, however bitter,
fully convinced do I feel of the needs be for the draught;
and at this moment I do ardently long that the design of it may be fully answered.
The last month has been marked by many mercies, and not the least of these,
I desire to remember, my bodily infirmities.
It has pleased my heavenly Father to prove to me, in a new way,
that I am most unworthy of His love; and, ardently longing to follow on to know Him,
I would, at this moment, crave that His arm of power may still be manifested,
to bear me above every billow which may toss my shattered bark.
Compassionate Jesus!
I do rejoice in the remembrance of thy love; and in the hours of my extremest need,
the knowledge that thou hast "`suffered, being tempted,`" is unspeakably precious.
May the sweet influences of thy Spirit be shed more and more abroad in my heart,
and may my whole will be conformed to Him.

3mo. 3rd.--Earnestly sought entire resignation to the divine will--ability to say,
in sincerity, if thy presence go not with me, take me not up from hence!

4th.--Was too much overcome with the consideration of the
little aid I have been able to extend to my beloved family,
during my present stay at home; not marking, as I ought to have done, the matchless,
boundless love,
which I cannot but feel this fresh proof of the
remembrance of my God has sweetly manifested.
Before night I was strengthened to bless Him for it.

5th.--I awoke early,
and spent a considerable time in prayer--fervently
craving ability to perform the divine will;
and in faithful obedience I longed to be favoured to know more of "`the heights and
depths of the love of Christ,`" increasing with the "`increase of God.`"
Spent most of the afternoon in B+++_______+++ Street, where, with intense interest,
I watched my dear brothers and sisters.
Oh how many,
many prayers have ascended from my heart for
these beloved ones! and must continue to ascend;
and poor, worthless as they are, I do rejoice in the humble conviction,
that they are accepted through Him in whose name they are offered.

7th.--Went by packet to Swansea,
and during the voyage my mind was preserved in great quietness--many
sweet passages of scripture were recalled to my remembrance,
and comforted me.
"`Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee,`" was fulfilled,
and though quite ill with sickness and pain, the hours passed rapidly away.
I was weary when I reached E+++______+++.

16th.--This day twelvemonths I watched, for the first time,
the "`putting off of mortality,`" and the deep impressions made at this time,
of almost overpowering interest, will never, I trust, be effaced from my heart.
The removal of a beloved friend is, I have found,
sweetly calculated to drive us nearer Him who, "`of all others,
is most worth possessing.`"
Since dear +++_______+++`'s death,
my heart has again and again been smitten by the severe stroke of separation;
but I have been most mercifully dealt with,
and I now only long for the yielding more of the peaceable fruits of righteousness,
which ought to be produced by the "`chastening of the Lord.`"
During the morning had much conversation with
dearest +++_______+++ respecting my precious S+++______+++,
and the remembrance of her I found almost overpowering; yet, in my time of retirement,
I earnestly sought strength from above, not only to continue to bow to the divine will,
but to give thanks on her behalf!
And in the contemplation of the severing of my ties to earth,
may I be stimulated to seek closer union with Him who, in all the vicissitudes of time,
will ever be the same unchangeable and ever present friend.

18th.--Had a precious season of access to the throne of grace, in my time of quietness,
and felt refreshed and comforted.
Very earnestly did I ask of the Father of mercies,
in the name and for the sake of my blessed Saviour,
continued guidance and support in my onward way; and,
under a sweet conviction that "`we know not what to pray for as we ought,`"
but as "`the Spirit helpeth our infirmities,`" my soul was bowed in fervent
longings after ability to walk in the fear and love of God,
and to be united more closely to my endeared friends in the precious bonds of the gospel.

19th.--A lovely morning.
All around me was calculated to impress my heart with love and gratitude,
and in my time of stillness,
I earnestly sought an increase in "`the increase of God!`" but
to be kept very low at my Saviour`'s feet--there only,
I know, is safety to be found by me--and to be kept there, even through deep suffering,
I now regard as my choicest blessing.
Most of the morning and afternoon were spent with my much loved friends in the open air,
and greatly did I enjoy the contemplation of the beautiful
works of God--whilst for myself and loved ones,
(and for those, especially,
with whom I have lately been privileged to rest) I craved
ability to look more constantly beyond terrestrial things,
to the eternal world--to live more constantly to "`Him who died for us, and rose again.`"
The recollection of this being the last day of the week has,
in recurring to the events of it, been, on some accounts, painful,
because I have not been so constantly watchful as ought to have been the case;
yet the renewed and precious conviction of the boundless mercies of my God,
excites humble gratitude and heartfelt desire to resign myself wholly to Him.

26th.--I rose early, and spent a longer time than usual in waiting on the Lord;
and although my thoughts wandered too much, part of the time, to terrestrial things,
it proved a season of renewal of strength--and
ardent were my desires for heavenly sustenance.
During the morning I was preserved in watchfulness;
but in the afternoon I spoke to the disadvantage of another,
and severe suffering followed.
The recollection of this, and the whole retrospect of the past week,
ought deeply to humble me,
whilst unnumbered blessings demand the tribute of gratitude and praise,
and ought constantly to induce the inquiry, "`What shall I render?`"
After seeking at the divine footstool, not only forgiveness for the past,
but help for the future, my heart was filled with desires for all my loved family,
relations, and friends--and oh, I do desire to be more deeply humbled,
to be kept very low at my Saviour`'s feet!
A sweet calm was permitted to cover my spirit after tea;
how little did I imagine that it would be removed by the almost overwhelming,
and entirely unlooked for, intelligence conveyed in a letter from my sister.
My much loved friend E. C+++______+++ has been called on to "`put
off mortality,`" and again my heart has been bowed down!
Oh that every severing may be the means of uniting me more closely to Jesus!
Keep me very near unto thee, I pray thee, for His sake, O Lord.
Yes, even through the severest discipline, make me wholly thine.

27th.--Very fervently craved, in my time of retirement, help from the sanctuary,
to support and strengthen me.
"`Ask of me, and I will show thee great and mighty things,
which thou knowest not,`" was the precious promise sweetly recalled,
and impressed on my remembrance.
During meeting, and whilst bowed down, I was yet strengthened, at times,
to rejoice in spirit, for the fresh manifestation of divine love towards me,
in removing another of my ties to earth.
Oh that each succeeding trial may prove to me,
as a "`feather to the bird,`" a help to soar towards heaven!
I have not profited to the degree I ought, by my repeated chastenings,
and therefore trial is yet necessary for me,
for the dross and the tin to be purely purged away.
Oh I have longed renewedly, this morning, to be conformed to my Saviour`'s image;
and I would yet crave the continuance of chastisement,
until the design of it be fully accomplished--only would I still ask, divine support.
My heart was deeply bowed down on my return, but during meeting,
in the afternoon--although terrestrial things, at times,
too much engaged my thoughts--I was permitted to know a renewal of strength;
and after tea, a short time of stillness was helpful to me,
from the renewed and sweet conviction,
that we have a "`High Priest touched with a feeling of
our infirmities,`" and that He is ever near,
not only to hear our cry, but also to succour and to save.
Very earnestly have I desired that He may be with me this evening,
and keep my thoughts fixed on Him.

4mo. 4th.--In drawing near the throne of grace,
I was permitted to experience strength and refreshment
in the contemplation of the Christian`'s armour.
I long to be more constantly bearing all of it.
"`The shield of faith`"--oh how sweet the assurance--wherewith
ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.`"
Oh that this shield may be ours, that we may be able to "`stand in the day of battle.`"
In the afternoon I was, at times, completely overcome;
many mingled feelings bowed down my spirit,
yet I was strengthened to approach the divine footstool,
and to know a renewal of help from above.
A sweet calm followed the tossing,
and I was enabled to commit my way unto the Lord--and to Him, on retiring to rest,
I desired to render the tribute of unbounded gratitude
for all his mercies--my unworthiness of which,
I desire to be more and more sensible of.

11th.--Rose at four, with feelings of great calmness.
"`I prevented the dawning of my morning, and cried,`" was impressed on my remembrance,
and I was strengthened to cry unto Him who heareth and answereth prayer.
On leaving my beloved friends, much gratitude filled my heart, not only towards them,
but to that gracious Being who still loadeth me with benefits.
During the day my mind was sweetly and deeply alive to the things of God.
I longed after increased ability to live unto Him,
whilst my spirit was bowed in deep sympathy with my endeared friends.
On approaching Bristol, very fervent was my desire after preservation.
After tea, I was strengthened, in a season of retirement,
to approach the throne of grace, and cast my burden, in a small degree,
on Him who mercifully careth for us.
At this time, perhaps dearest +++_______+++ and +++_______+++
are entering their brother`'s chamber.
Whether he be still an inhabitant of earth,
or his spirit released from the tabernacle of clay, do thou, O gracious God,
for the sake of Him who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities--do thou be very,
very near them, and sustain them, and all who are suffering with them,
with a sense of thy omnipotence and omnipresence.

17th, First day.--Rose with fervent desires to be enabled, this day,
to live and walk "`in the Spirit!`"
In meeting, the sweet influences of the Spirit of God were deeply impressed on my heart,
and I longed to know them more and more spread
abroad there--for I am increasingly convinced,
that it is only through the Spirit that any man can rightly call Jesus Lord.
In the evening meeting my spirit was, at times,
deeply bowed with a sense of the desolation which has spread
within the borders of our part of the great vineyard--and very
fervently did I crave of my heavenly Father ability to prove,
by my walk,
my attachment to those doctrines which I believe to be the doctrines of the gospel.
On my return home this continued to be the ardent craving of my soul.
Oh that, in infinite mercy, this may be my blessed experience,
or that I may be taken "`out of the world.`"

19th.--Felt a little quiet a great comfort; and in it I earnestly desired,
and was favoured to know, a renewal of strength.
As the disciples formerly returned to their heavenly Master,
and told Him all they had done,
so I believe it to be the privilege of the humble disciple to come unto Him now, and,
through the precious influences of His Spirit,
offer to Him the tribute of gratitude and praise!

28th.--A vivid sense of the privilege of "`sleeping in Jesus,`"
led me to rejoice for those who,
we may confidently believe, have entered on this blissful rest.
On behalf of my precious S+++______+++, I was strengthened to give thanks;
whilst for my dear parents, each of my brothers and sisters, my relations,
and all my loved friends,
in fervent supplication I was strengthened to approach the throne of grace,
and crave the blessing of the Lord!
Oh how unspeakably great is the believer`'s privilege!`"
A new and living way`" having been opened into the holiest,
"`by the blood of Jesus,`" he is permitted to draw near;
and oh that I may yet more and more be enabled to do so,
with a "`true heart in full assurance of faith.`"

5mo. 1st.--A want of fervency in my desires after heavenly good,
led me very seriously to consider and in doing so, I could not but be painfully sensible,
that I have not been sufficiently "`watchful unto prayer.`"
So deep a conviction of this was permitted me, as to lead me earnestly to crave,
that my ways may be truly searched--that my thoughts may be tried--and that
I may be strengthened to go faithfully forwards in the way everlasting.
With a deeper sense of sin,
I long to have more earnest or more constant desires for deliverance from it.

4th.--I left the parental roof; and although with mingled feelings,
unspeakable gratitude prevailed in my heart,
for the unnumbered mercies which have been strewed in
my way;`" and during the whole of my journey,
the importance of those things which are eternal,
deeply impressed me--whilst for myself and all my beloved ones,
I earnestly desired ability to press forwards in the heavenly race, looking unto Jesus.

Leominster, 7th.--During the morning I spent some time alone,
and in recurring to the past week, felt cause for heartfelt thankfulness,
and my soul was bowed in fervent prayer for preservation,
and the continued experience of divine guidance.
O that I may be kept by the power of God! and that in my daily
walk I may be enabled faithfully to follow Jesus,
my condescending and compassionate heavenly Guide.
From many causes my path appears covered with clouds,
yet these are marked with many gleams of mercy,
and all I can desire is preservation from evil--ability to keep close unto Jesus,
for there, and there only can I find safety.
For many beloved ones, I cannot but be bowed in spirit;
and oh may I be strengthened to seek, yet more constantly and earnestly,
"`help from the sanctuary!`"
Before I retired to rest, my heart felt almost overwhelmed within me,
yet I was strengthened, in some degree, to commit my way unto the Lord.

14th.--In dear S+++______+++`'s leaving me I have felt again, most deeply,
the giving up the duties which for nearly seven years have devolved
upon me--(alluding to the care of her younger brothers and sisters)--
and which must be ever thought of with the deepest interest,
and with humble gratitude for the help mercifully afforded in the discharge of them.
For the precious children, here and at my beloved home,
my heart has been raised in fervent prayer that they may be taught, led,
guided by the "`good Shepherd.`"

17th.--Oh how do I long that the knowledge of Jesus may
cover the earth as the waters do the sea!
Yet what a work is there to be done before the fulfilment of the gracious prophecy!
O that we may individually, faithfully inquire what part we are to take in it,
and earnestly seek help from the great Husbandman,
to sow or to water that which He alone can make to take root in His vineyard;
and which He alone can make to yield the increase.

18th.--My evening retirement was marked by fervent longings after holiness,
not only in my own soul, but those of all my loved ones; and at this-time, especially,
for the servants in this house, over whom I feel now that I must watch,
even as one who is to give an account.

27th.--I went a walk in the evening, and ere I did so, I sincerely desired that it might,
in some way, be made profitable.
Went part of the way quite new to me,
came to a cottage whose inhabitants appear to be in a state of the greatest ignorance;
oh that I may be strengthened by the "`good Shepherd,`"
to do what He would have me to do for them.

31st.--Earnestly desired, in my time of retirement, divine protection and guidance.
Very mercifully enabled to look up for, and to receive help, during morning school;
and afterwards my mind was kept in sweet watchfulness.
Yet in recurring to this time, I fear I have given way, though almost unconsciously,
to too high thoughts of myself.
Oh, that my spirit may be deeply humbled, really contrited,
before the Lord--surely to me belongs nothing but "`blushing and confusion of face.`"
In the afternoon I was strengthened to keep on the watch tower,
and in a walk in the evening, this was also my blessed experience.
We called again on the poor family,
and the appearance of the children deeply interested me--we began teaching them.
O how earnestly do I desire that our labours may
be blessed by the great and good Shepherd!

On my return home, my heart glowed with love to Him,
and to all my fellow creatures for His sake,
desiring the eternal welfare of all--whilst for myself, I craved preservation from evil.
How precious, how invigorating, are the felt rays of the Sun of Righteousness,
when the clouds are hid from the sight,
and the Christian traveller is enabled to place
entire confidence in the God of his salvation!
This evening has been one of inexpressible sweetness to me.
Oh that the remembrance of it may prove strengthening and encouraging.
When cloud after cloud passes over me,
may I be kept close unto Jesus--even should He yet be
pleased for me to go as into the garden of Gethsemane,
and unto Calvary`'s mount.
May I be made willing to drink of His cup and to be baptized with His baptism!

6mo. 9th.--This day--long marked by feelings of the tenderest interest,
as the birthday of my dearest S+++______+++,
commenced with indescribable feelings in the recollection of the truth,
that no more desires on her behalf,
are needed--no more fervent craving for her deliverance from every discouragement,
and advancement in the path of holiness;
her warfare is accomplished! her sun has set forever in this
world! but I doubt not she has entered the haven of rest;
and in approaching the throne of grace, in my morning watch,
I was enabled to feel that a rich privilege has been granted her.
Each hour this day, my thoughts were with my precious, and now, I trust,
glorified friend;
yet I was strengthened to attend to my daily
duties--and though in the remembrance of these,
I feel cause for fresh humiliation,
I would also gratefully acknowledge the help afforded me.
My thoughts are known only to the Searcher of hearts but I
have felt the known sympathy of some of my friends,
this day, truly precious, and one of my many mercies! and whilst bowed down in spirit,
in the evening, inexpressibly sweet was the conviction,
that we who are yet sojourners here, are still united to those who are gone before us,
having the same Shepherd.
And though we yet must drink of the streams,
and know what it is to thirst again--whilst they are led to living fountains of waters,
and will hunger and thirst no more forever--it is but a narrow passage between us,
and we know not how soon we may be called upon to cross it!
May we be found with our lamps burning,
from the constant supplies of the oil of divine love.

12th.--Enabled with much fervency to desire the best
welfare of my much loved family and many friends.
For poor +++_______+++ and +++_______+++ especially, I craved deliverance from the yoke of sin,
and preservation from its heavy chains.
Terrestrial things were too frequently before me in evening meeting,
yet very fervent were my desires for the manifestation of best help to my loved family,
friends, and my own soul, as we pursue life`'s chequered way.
An almost overpowering sense of the weight of sin, makes me long, at seasons,
after a more perfect conformity to the will of
God in all around as well as in my own steppings.
I long for a more constant realization of the presence of my heavenly Shepherd.
May I be brought and kept yet nearer to Him.

26th.--My birthday!
I woke about the time at which this time twenty-three years I came into existence.
Some of the precious promises of Scripture were sweetly recalled to my remembrance;
and peace, an almost overflowing peace filled my heart--whilst for my own soul,
and many beloved ones, the prayer ascended, I trust, through the blessed Mediator,
to the "`Father of mercies!`"
In morning meeting, deep feeling almost overpowered my heart,
and continued to mark this important day--a craving
after ability to walk in the "`newness of life.`"
The last twelve months have been months of ever memorable interest!
Again and again have I been placed in the furnace,
and again and again has my heavenly Guide mercifully
proved His power to save and succour there!
Some of my closest ties to earth have been severed--a new way has
been opened before me--unnumbered blessings have been showered upon
me--whilst continued sins of commission and omission have made me,
at times, deeply sensible of my own entire unworthiness of them.
My heart has again and again been bowed, in panting after the water of life, and I have,
at seasons, been graciously permitted to feel refreshed thereby.
With feelings of gratitude the day closed, and with earnest desire to be strengthened,
should life be spared, the ensuing year, each day "`to live to the glory of God!`"
I long after a more constant realization of the presence of my heavenly Shepherd,
and I do earnestly crave, that even through the discipline of severe suffering,
I may be brought to feel this!
Oh that my words, my thoughts,
may be brought entirely into subjection to the obedience of Christ,
that I may attain to a measure of the stature of His fulness.

7mo. 2nd.--In the evening we had a sweet walk.
My thoughts were raised above the things of time; and on my return,
my season of retirement was permitted to be refreshing to me,
and I was strengthened earnestly to crave the divine blessing
for each member of my loved family--all my relations and
friends--the servants--and all my fellow creatures.
Oh, how sweet is the privilege of ability, through the great Mediator,
to draw near to the mercy seat--there to be permitted to meet in spirit,
our beloved fellow travellers Zionwards,
who are still sojourners here--there to feel that we may join
those who are become members of the church triumphant,
even whilst still on earth, in ascribing praises to Him "`who sitteth on the throne,
and to the Lamb;`" and there, from time to time,
to seek and receive ability to go faithfully forwards in the path of obedience.

8mo. 30th.--Suffered loss in the morning, from giving way to wandering thoughts,
whilst attending to the little children.
In my evening retirement,
earnestly longed for ability to watch more and more over the passing moments.

10mo. 13th.--General meeting at Hereford.
In the second meeting my soul was so deeply impressed
with a few encouraging words to a beloved friend,
that I suffered much from withholding them.
In the midst of mental anguish, I wish to be clearly shown my way,
and to be strengthened to walk therein, convinced, that in obedience alone,
can I find peace; and to be preserved from future rebellion,
was the ardent craving of my soul.
I pant for the full participation in the richest blessings of the gospel.
My soul thirsteth for living water,
nor can that thirst be fully satisfied until
quenched forever at the everlasting fountain.

29th.--After a time of retirement,
in which terrestrial things too much occupied my thoughts,
"`Do with me as it seemeth good in thy sight`" was the language of my heart.
During the morning was enabled to get on satisfactorily.
Went a second time to see a poor woman in consumption,
with earnest desire to be strengthened to act rightly.
Whilst with her, after explaining to her our views of prayer,
I trusted the reading of a chapter would be all that would be called for at my hands;
but I was not satisfied,
and I was afterwards enabled vocally to supplicate on
her behalf at the footstool of divine mercy.
On my return home the remembrance of this produced very solemn feelings in my mind.
Another week, marked with many mercies, is now drawing to a close,
and whilst feeling my own many shortcomings,
and renewedly made sensible of the goodness of the Lord,
I desire afresh to commit myself, and all who are dear to me, to His keeping,
only asking that His will may be accomplished.
I have, lately, afresh felt the privilege and the benefit of a long season of retirement,
before entering on the busy scenes of the day;
and I have longed to be permitted to have such, and to spend them rightly.

10mo. 9th.--I was visited by the friends appointed to
inform me of the receipt of my certificate,
and I was strengthened to tell them what my earnest
desires had been in becoming a member of their meeting;
not in my way to burden,
but to be qualified more and more to feel for them and with them.

12mo. 8th.--One year, today, has passed away,
since one of the most precious ties of my existence was
suddenly severed--since my tenderly loved S+++______+++ was,
I cannot doubt, through redeeming mercy, permitted to enter the realms of bliss.
This sweet conviction has, this morning, yielded consolation no other could bestow;
whilst I have craved for myself, that close walk with God,
which only can enable us fully to realize the union existing
between the "`church militant,`" and the "`church triumphant.`"
After passing the day more satisfactorily than has sometimes been the case,
though at seasons, my heart was indeed heavy, I was, I trust,
thankful for the privilege of an unusually quiet evening.
As I believe the chastenings of the Lord,
are mercifully designed for the furtherance of the work of grace in the soul,
so the remembrance of them should lead to close examination of the steps of our feet.
In reviewing those I have lately taken, I have, I trust, been humbled;
whilst the prayer of my soul has been, "`Teach me, O Lord, and know my heart, try me,
and know my thoughts.`"

11th.--In recurring to the meeting in the afternoon,
and the times set apart for public worship, latterly, I have been brought deeply to feel,
that they have not been so profitable as should have been the case,
and seriously to inquire, why it is so?
Surely this query can alone be rightly answered, with the language,
"`My soul cleaveth to the dust!`"
In reflecting on this, "`Quicken thou me,
according to thy word,`" was the fervent petition of my soul,
accompanied by the desire that every evil thought, as well as word and action,
may be brought into judgment.

20th.--This day was passed under feelings of very great bodily oppression, yet,
at moments I was strengthened to rise above them,
and dwell on those which are connected with things unseen.
I earnestly desired ability to forget myself and my own infirmities,
and to be lost in that love,
which would lead more fully to seeking to bear the burdens of others.

28th.--Our monthly meeting was held here.
Two or three subjects were mentioned on which I felt much,
yet I shrunk from expressing my feelings.
In recurring to this, and all the events of this day,
I very earnestly desire to look more simply and singly unto Jesus every step of my way,
being more entirely preserved from a reasoning spirit.

31st.--At night, before retiring to rest,
endeavoured to retrace some of the events of the past year;
rich blessings have marked it, many, very many unmerited mercies have followed me;
but I have not been so obedient to my heavenly
Father`'s voice as should have been the case.
I have wandered again and again from Him,
refusing to yield entire obedience to what has appeared His requirings.
Yet, gracious and omnipotent God, I am, at this time,
deeply sensible that to thee belongeth all I have and am;
and I would fervently crave of thee, for the sake of my compassionate Saviour,
ability to give myself up unreservedly unto thee!
Do thou do with me as it seemeth thee good--only leave me not.
Keep me from wandering from thee, even if thou seest it needful for me yet to learn,
'`in the way of thy judgments to wait for thee.`'
I am the clay and thou the potter; and oh, gracious Father, enable me to resign myself,
body, soul, and spirit, unto thee, to be made whatever seemeth good in thy sight.
My many, many mercies,
demand my most grateful acknowledgements--my continual
wanderings incite me to crave thy forgiveness;
and for my own soul, and those of my beloved parents, brothers, sisters,
relations and friends, and all my fellow creatures,
I would entreat thy blessing--make us thine, O Lord now and forever.
We know not how many of our circle will, ere another year has passed,
have left this changing scene; but we do know that for life, as well as death,
we need preparation; and I would crave of thee,
the felt influences of thy Spirit for myself and loved ones.--I watched the new year in,
with ardent desires after strength for all my need, during it.

1837, 1mo. 14th.-- Recurring to the past week ought deeply to humble me.
I have, through unwatchfulness, become far too lukewarm in my progress Zionwards.
I have need, indeed,
to fear '`the treacherous calm,`' and yet I fear I do not do so sufficiently.
The many ways in which the enemy of our souls presents himself to us, have, at this time,
some of them been placed before me; and in looking on them, I can, I trust,
with sincerity, adopt the language, '`Help thou, O Lord, for vain is the help of man!`"
I would, too, at this moment,
crave deliverance from my present thraldom--though it
be needful for me to feel the rod again and again.
I may indeed say, with +++_______+++, "`Strike, strike, but oh, do not leave me!`"

22nd.--I rose with earnest desires to spend the day rightly,
and in sweet access to the throne of grace,
craved the blessing of the subjugation of my own will, or rather,
the furtherance of this work.
I am deeply sensible that the will of the creature should be wholly subdued, and I do,
at moments, long that it may be so.
In morning meeting my heart was bowed in fervent prayer that it might be searched,
as with candles, that every unclean thing might be seen and purged out.

2mo. 9th.--Ardent were the desires of my soul
for more entire conformity to the divine will.
Through my unwatchfulness my feet strayed,
and I suffered deeply from a sense of my unworthiness during most of the day.
Although compassed with infirmities, it was sweet to me, at times,
to feel that there is one "`touched with a sympathy divine`" for them.
I feel thankful in recurring to this suffering.
I could not ask to be spared any calculated to promote my best good.

11th.--I rose with a deep sense of the power of the Lord,
and I was enabled fervently to crave His guidance and protection during the day.
The retrospect of the last week should be truly humbling--oh that it may be really so.
The present is a solemnly impressive time.
Many of the events of the passing scene appear to be loudly calling upon all of us
to prepare for the last summons--to inquire most diligently how our accounts stand
with God--whether we have indeed found reconciliation with Him,
through His beloved Son.
Are we enabled, through the influences of His holy Spirit,
to bring forth the "`fruits of righteousness?`"
"`Burdened with sin`'s oppressive load,`" and this made heavier from yielding to it,
it is an unspeakably precious privilege to be
permitted to draw near to the throne of grace,
and pour out our sorrows in the ears of a compassionate Saviour!

21st.--I have lately felt very solicitous to have an infant school established here;
or rather, a school on that system.
Very many discouragements have prevailed, but I trust we shall yet see,
in this kind of establishment, fruit which shall abound.
I do earnestly desire divine assistance in doing all that I can to promote it.

3mo. 11th.--Arose with a deep sense of the precious privilege
of having "`an Advocate with the Father;`" and,
in my time of retirement, it was sweet to confide myself to Him,
craving His continued support and presence,--"`an
increase of the blessings of goodness.`"
The past week has been one of deep interest, and in recurring to it,
I feel abundant cause for thankfulness, as well as for deep self-abasement.
Oh, my soul, what owest thou?
May I, in frequently making this query, be humbled,
whilst desiring to give up my all to Him to whom it belongs!

[.offset]
+++[+++At this time she came to Bristol on a visit.]

16th.--Deeply feeling my need of best help for the performance of my duty this day,
I was strengthened with earnestness to seek it.
I am sensible that it is necessary for me each hour, each minute, to be helped of God,
or my feet must slide.
Oh leave me not, gracious Father, but be thou very near me,
for the sake of Him who has suffered, being tempted.
Thou knowest how easily I am persuaded.
Thou knowest how frail have proved many of my best resolutions.
Oh do thou uphold me by thine arm of power--do thou be very, very near me.

18th.--Whilst a sense of the infinite importance of
eternal things has pressed heavily upon my spirit,
I have deeply felt my need of an increase of faith, to enable me,
whilst passing through this wilderness, to live above it--having my eye fixed on Jesus,
and knowing the influences of His Holy Spirit to
be more and more shed abroad in my heart.

25th.--Daily experience convinces me, that I must not seek great things for myself,
and yet, I earnestly long after the "`fulness of the blessings of the gospel of Christ.`"
Gracious Father!
I would earnestly beseech thee, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to teach me what to ask for, and to pour upon me the spirit of grace and of supplication.
How solemn is the thought of the rapidity with which time is passing away.
Oh, my soul! how many have been the blessings showered upon
thee!--how deep is thy responsibility!
The fervent craving of my soul at this time is, that my compassionate Saviour, (and oh,
how do I rejoice in believing it,) my Intercessor with the Father,
may be yet more and more my all in all.

4mo. 2nd.--Had some interesting conversation with +++_______+++,
who told me she could now hope that the Sun of Righteousness would arise on her
with healing in his wings--that she should have "`the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.`"
She was, however, afraid of expressing her feelings, and also afraid,
that although she knew so much of the spirit of heaviness,
she had not known enough of mourning.
After the deep discouragement which my dear +++_______+++ has so much felt,
I cannot but regard it as a cause for much thankfulness,
that a ray of light has dawned upon her way, and cheered her burdened spirit!
Oh how do I desire, that, if consistent with her heavenly Father`'s will,
this light may increase and dispel all darkness;
that my endeared +++_______+++ may be led from strength to strength;
that the work of grace may be carried forwards until fully accomplished.

21st.--Almost overpowering has again been my interest on account of +++_______+++,
to whom I feel very closely bound.
Oh that my deep interest for others may lead to still closer self-examination--may
more continually lead to the strictest scrutiny of my own conduct--of my hourly
steppings in the narrow way! "`Do thou be very near me,`" was,
in the retrospect of the day the language of my heart.

30th. First day.--Another week has opened before me; another month has nearly closed!
Oh my soul, how deeply hast thou, in the last four weeks,
proved the boundless mercy of thy God!
Oh that I may, in the ensuing week,
be strengthened to live very near my heavenly Guide--there alone, am I fully convinced,
can I find safety.
In the morning I remained at home with my beloved mother.
The greater part of the time my spirit participated in the feeling of
bodily oppression which was permitted to be my portion,
but I was strengthened to feel very earnest desires on my beloved mother`'s account,
and on my own.
Oh I can hardly bear to realize parting from her.
Do thou who only knowest the trial it is to me, be very near me,
and manifest thy daily will concerning me--granting ability to perform it.
I am weak but thou art strong, yea, mighty to deliver!
May this conviction help me on my way, by leading me very often to the throne of grace,
where, through the blessed Mediator,
we are mercifully permitted to draw near to the Father of Mercies.

5mo. 4th.--A very deep sense of my need of best help,
led me earnestly to crave that it might be very near me this day.
Again I am about to enter on my important duties at Leominster.
Oh that wisdom from above may direct my steps!
To part from my friends here will cause me a severe pang, but believing, as I do,
that it is to pursue the path of duty, I trust that this, also,
will prove to be among the "`all things`" which shall work together for my good.
I much desire that it may be so.
Arrived at Leominster, where I was, I trust, truly thankful to be, and where I hope,
with renewed earnestness,
I may be strengthened to attend to my important duties--bearing more constantly in
mind that "`this is not my rest,`" and desiring that every little trial,
yea, that all things, may work together for my good.

5th.--This continued to be the breathing of my soul.
The sweet and warm affection of the children I felt very precious!
Oh that I may be increasingly qualified to watch over them in love.
Was humbled, I trust, by a remark of a friend concerning me.
Poor, weak, and of myself entirely helpless,
I do indeed feel that it is little I can do for others.
Oh that I may, through constant faithfulness,
be enabled more and more to feel for and with them.

19th.--Some days passed in bed, and in bodily suffering.
A sweet sense of the love which marked the chastening was, however, present with me,
and I was enabled, in a good degree, to commit my all unto the Lord.

31st.--The continuance of my cough, and other unfavourable symptoms, have led me,
at moments, to think,
that possibly "`a very narrow stream`" alone may
separate me from the dearly loved ones who,
I confidently trust, are safely landed on Canaan`'s happy shore!
The thought was an almost absorbingly interesting one,
but it was followed by ardent desire for preparation and willingness to live or die,
if only strengthened to do the divine will.

6mo. 8th.--How can I record the feelings of my heart during the last two days!
The last four have been marked in my experience in a manner unknown before,
yet calculated, sweetly calculated, to prove and humble me.
The appearance of a symptom of disease I never had before, and serious in its nature,
has placed afresh before me the great uncertainty of my long continuance here,
and renewed my earnest longings to be made fully meet for the "`inheritance of the
saints in bliss;`" having my robes washed and made white in the blood of the Lamb;
knowing the sanctifying, purifying influence of the Spirit of Jesus.
Under a deep sense of divine love and mercy, I have been, at times,
almost overwhelmed with the fear of wandering from my heavenly Leader;
not sufficiently realizing His power and willingness to save--thus have I
found it difficult to resign myself fully unto Him for life or death.
Now I would afresh crave of Him ability to do this, and to walk humbly before Him,
should health and strength again be permitted to be my portion--
should I again have to engage in life`'s busy scenes.

11th.--The great enemy of our souls`' peace was permitted, for a season,
to come in as an almost overwhelming flood;
his fierce temptations appeared in all their strength before me,
and made me again feel it very difficult fully to resign myself, for life or death,
into the hands of my God.
A sense of boundless mercies bowed my soul,
together with the heavy responsibility involved by my situation.
Early brought to feel the precious efficacy of a Saviour`'s blood, my heart should,
long ere this, have been wholly His! my actions, words,
and thoughts being brought into subjection by
the restraining power of His blessed Spirit!
But how has it been with me?
Thou only knowest, O Lord,
who art acquainted with all my ways--who knowest
the motives which have led to all my actions,
some of which to man may have appeared good!
Oh how can I record thy infinite, unbounded love!
After proving these I have felt, this day, the almost overwhelming power of the enemy.
What base ingratitude I have shewn!
Be thou graciously pleased, for the sake of Him who, I humbly rejoice in believing,
was wounded for my transgressions, to look down again in pity on thy child,
and strengthen her to commit her all unto thee--only craving that thy will may be done,
that she may be brought very low, and that Christ Jesus thy beloved Son,
may become her "`all in all.`"
On reading the foregoing, I feel I should add,
that for a time I did not in any way realize the Saviour`'s power to succour;
but after a season of sore buffeting from our unwearied adversary,
I was mercifully permitted to feel that the Spirit of
the Lord had raised up a standard against him.
Some precious promises were recalled to my remembrance,
with a sure hope that they may be fulfilled in my experience.

23rd.--In recurring to some of the memorable events of my extreme illness,
my heart was much impressed; and very earnest desire prevailed there,
after preservation from those temptations which I then
fondly hoped I should be exposed to no more forever.
In the evening parted from my beloved M. E. with whom I
have enjoyed many sweet hours of intercourse.
The distance which separates us, and the uncertainty which, from my state of health,
hangs over the future, rendered parting particularly painful;
but I was mercifully strengthened, and enabled to commit my endeared friend,
with my own soul to the care of Him who, I humbly trust, will care for us--making,
as we continue faithful, "`hard things easy, and crooked things straight.`"

25th--The last day of my twenty-fourth year.
What a truly solemn consideration!
May the retrospect and close examination of the past, lead me, with greater earnestness,
to press forwards in the heavenly race.
Unutterable love and mercy have, during the last twelve months,
been sweetly manifested towards me.
My Saviour`'s arm has again and again been extended for
my help when my feet "`had well nigh slipped.`"
He has, in tender lovingkindness,
carried me in the arms of His love over many rough places,
and continued in compassion to visit my "`transgressions with the rod,
and my iniquity with stripes.`"
Very many have been my sins of omission and commission,
and deeply humbling should the remembrance of these prove;
whilst the knowledge that my "`Redeemer liveth,`" and liveth
to make intercession for the sheep and lambs of His flock,
conveys unspeakable consolation.
Yet I do desire that all that is comparable to the dross, the tin,
and the reprobate silver may be consumed by the purifying,
sanctifying power of His Spirit.

26th.--Some sweetly encouraging promises of scripture were recalled to my remembrance,
and conveyed much consolation.
My heart glowed with love to my fellow creatures;
and a retrospect of the past year so richly marked with mercy,
although by such continued shortcomings,
was accompanied by most ardent desire for ability to follow on to know the Lord.
Deeply feeling my own unworthiness,
but having a more constant sense of the fulness there is in Jesus,
I do especially desire increased humility, more constant consideration for others,
more fervent longing to profit by the scriptures,
and a more entire surrender of my own will.
Thou, who alone knowest my frailty knowest the extent of my wants.
O gracious Father! be thou pleased, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
to manifest these more and more to me,
and enable me more earnestly to seek a supply of them,
from the source of everlasting strength.
At this moment I feel that I cannot look a day forwards,
and I would ask of thee ability constantly to leave the morrow
in thy hands--only craving thy help for the present hour!
I rejoice in the conviction that thy love is still extended towards me; and,
under a renewed and deep sense of unworthiness, I would earnestly pray,
that thou wouldst keep, preserve, and strengthen me in the way of thy commandments.

+++[+++It was thought that the air of the sea-side might prove beneficial to her,
and she was removed at this time to Aberystwith.]

7mo. 4th.--My thoughts during the journey were not so
fixed as they ought to have been on divine things.
I had much weariness of body,
but seasons of deep self-examination--the very many mercies of
the past eight weeks were recalled to my remembrance,
and were accompanied by the query,
What have I profited by them and the chastenings I have had?
And very earnestly did I long that the present quietness permitted us,
which we may never enjoy again,
may be really and lastingly profitable! that we may spend it
in converse to which we may recur with satisfaction,
should years be added to our lives--in close self-examination,
and desires after living water.

9th.--My faith was again tried by the violence of the cough,
but I was strengthened to commend myself to my heavenly Father`'s care;
and in desiring of Him ability to leave all I possess in His hands,
I was permitted to feel comforted; but in recurring to this day,
marked in the outward by such sweet stillness,
I feel that I ought to be humbled by the want of earnestness I have evinced.
"`Oh for a heart to pray, to pray, and never cease!`"

11th.--This day I am likely to part with my beloved sister S+++______+++.
Oh that we may both feel the Rock of Israel to be our strength.
Now I am again separated from all the loved members of my own family.
I have, today, shed some tears in the recollection of this--but O my God,
do thou be graciously pleased, for my Saviour`'s sake, to forgive my weakness,
and make this separation the means of uniting me more closely unto thee!
Permit me to know more and more of the fulness there is in Christ;
and through the sweet influence of His Spirit in my heart,
oh enable me to grow from stature to stature.

19th.--How often have I found fulfilled in my experience the sweet assurance,
"`He stayeth His rough wind in the day of His east wind.`"
This day has been passed in much suffering,
but I felt my heavenly Friend to be so very near me,
that I was not tried with one anxious thought for the body.
Many precious promises of scripture were recalled to my recollection,
which were sweetly comforting, and I was enabled,
earnestly to long for the best welfare of my own soul,
and that of those dear to me--craving that we might be unitedly blessed.

22nd.--In my comparative seclusion I have known many seasons of sweetly enriching peace,
and my heart has been filled with desires that others might taste thereof.
Surely there is indeed no joy comparable to the joy of God`'s salvation.

24th.--In the evening had a refreshing time of stillness, in which,
after recurring to the past day,
I was led earnestly to desire spiritual blessings for myself and loved ones,
encouraged by the promise, "`Open, thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.`"
I long for a more constant realization of the presence of God,
and more fervency of spirit in reading the scriptures.
I also longed that my waking moments at night might be
more constantly occupied with things divine.
These blessings I have asked in the name and for the sake of Him who died for us,
and through whom alone we can have access unto the Father.

+++[+++During her stay at Aberystwith she penned the following supplication.]

Aberystwith, 5th day evening.--Renewedly and deeply sensible of the uncertainty of time,
and the certainty of death, I have, of late, increasingly longed,
that all who are dear to me may be made members of the church militant on earth,
and when their work here is accomplished, be admitted, through redeeming mercy,
to the church triumphant in heaven.
The frailty of my "`tabernacle of clay`" has, of late, been great;
and again and again have I thought it probable that it would soon be pulled down.
This I desire to leave to Him, who, in condescending mercy,
has cared for me all my life long, who continues, in unutterable love, to be very near,
to help and support.
But I would crave of thee, O Father of mercies, for the sake of thy beloved Son,
the extension of thy preserving power unto the end of my pilgrimage.
Whether it be long or short,
I would fervently pray that thy work may be fully accomplished in my
soul--that I may fully know the sanctifying power of thy Spirit.
And for my beloved parents,
I would ask thy blessing--bring them nearer and
nearer to thyself by the cords of thy love;
sanctify to them every trial thou permittest to be their portion,
and finally enable them to rejoice in thy salvation.
To those of my much loved brothers and sisters who have set their faces Zionward,
be thou a shield from all the darts of the enemy,
and strengthen them to go forwards--enabling them confidently to
trust that thou wilt be also their "`exceeding great reward!`"
And to those of our family who have not yet tasted of thy goodness,
be graciously pleased still to extend thy omnipotent arm;
make them deeply sensible of their shortcomings, and of the precious truth, that thou,
Lord, art "`good, and ready to forgive,
and plenteous in mercy unto all that call upon thee!`"
Oh leave them not, until, either to the voice of thy love, or of thy judgment,
they have bent their ear to hear, and have entered into covenant with thee!

Gracious Father! thou knowest all I would ask for my beloved relations,
and many valued friends;
thou knowest for whom my spirit has been bowed before thy throne of mercy.
Permit me still to ask, for these tenderly loved ones,
thy choicest blessings--let them know more and more of the treasures of thy goodness,
the depth of thy love towards them in Christ Jesus!
And for all thy people, and for them who may yet be afar off,
I would ask the continued extension of thy lovingkindness.
May the precious influences of thy Spirit be more and more shed abroad,
until from every heart incense shall be offered unto thee,
and a pure offering--until all are brought to the knowledge of thy Son,
and are prepared to offer, through Him, the song of endless thanksgiving and of praise!

8mo. 1st.--It has been very difficult to me to reconcile our
return to Leominster being hastened on my account,
yet I felt unable and restrained from pressing to the contrary.

2nd.--The weariness I felt, after a very restless night,
led me to rejoice that it had been fixed for us to set out on our journey.
I had less coughing in the morning, and felt better.
During our ride I enjoyed looking on the works of nature, and,
recurring to the mercies received during our stay at Aberystwith,
I was led earnestly to desire to be kept by divine power in the path of simple obedience.

15th.--A week has passed away since I last attempted here to write the
feelings of my heart--it has been a week marked by some memorable events,
and deep mental suffering.
After serious consideration of the subject,
it has been thought best for me to return to my beloved family.
And now amongst them,
I desire to give up my whole heart to the solemn work of preparation,
whether it be for life or death! to seek more and more
of the fulness of the blessings of the gospel!
The night before I left Leominster was one of refreshment to my spirit.
It was almost a sleepless one,
but one precious promise after another was recalled to my recollection,
to my unspeakable comfort,
and I was enabled to commit myself and all dear to me unto the Lord.
Then, in sincerity of soul, I cried,
"`And now come I to thee,`" to be made whatsoever is pleasing in thy sight!
The day on which I left Leominster I was sweetly strengthened.
In the few following days I have been deeply tried with the want of constant resignation,
though in craving this blessing I have felt, at times, not only strengthened,
but comforted.

29th.--Dear +++_______+++ has met with an accident.
How has my heart desired, in thinking of him, that it may be blessed to him,
whether it proves of a serious nature or not.
O thou who alone knowest our many wants, our very many infirmities, look down,
I pray thee, in mercy, on my dear brother,
incite in his heart fresh desires to serve thee--
coming unto thee through thy beloved Son,
enable him yet to glorify thee by walking in the newness of life.

31st.--Sweet peace was permitted to be the portion of my spirit.
In approaching the throne of grace, my heart was refreshed and strengthened,
and I was indeed made "`glad in the Lord`"--enabled with humble
confidence to leave the future and to rejoice in present blessings.
Oh that the remembrance of this season may be
animating as I pursue my course towards Zion.
The early part of the day was very peaceful,
but severe conflict marked part of the evening.
I read, with deep interest,
a sweet account of E. T. G+++______+++. Her happy experience led me
earnestly to long for deliverance from the power of temptation.
My spirit again trembled in the prospect of life and health,
but it was only for a season that this dark cloud covered my
way--it was mercifully pierced by beams of love and mercy,
and I was enabled to confide, in some degree, my all unto the Shepherd of Israel.

9mo. 2nd.--Another week has quickly passed away, another week, marked with mercy.
Oh my soul! what shouldst thou render unto the Lord, for all His benefits?
In deep self-abasement I would, afresh, crave ability to take the cup of thanksgiving,
and call upon the name of the Lord!
But how slow have I been to learn the lessons placed before me; each day, I feel,
presents some new one, or one not yet properly learned.
Oh that I may be more alive to the reproofs of
instruction which are still so mercifully afforded me.
In the evening,
a portion of that peace of God which passeth all understanding was permitted me,
and for a long season raised my soul above the
restless billows of life`'s tempestuous sea.
The heavenly Pilot condescended, in rich, unmerited mercy, to manifest His love,
in enabling me, unhesitatingly,
to commit my all into His keeping--in strengthening me to realize the
safety of all who "`trust under the shadow of His wing.`"

30th.--Much bodily oppression has marked the last few days,
and I have to mourn over drowsiness whilst attending to my highest duties.
It is comforting to me to believe that this has arisen
almost entirely from the state of the poor body,
and that He who knoweth our frame and remembereth that
we are dust will tenderly regard my many infirmities;
yet whilst myself feeling them, I long for a state in which, without sin,
I may praise and glorify the God of my salvation.

10mo. 25th.--During the last few days I have thought, with regret,
of the little I have lately done for the poor, in any way;
and I have earnestly desired to be shown in what way I can best "`consider`" them.
Very, very little is it in my power to do,
but I much desire rightly to attend to a duty which I believe to be required of us all.

11 mo.
7th.--Today I am likely partially to quit my sweet retirement in my pleasant chamber,^
footnote:[Alluding to her being thought so much
better as to be allowed to leave her room,
and mix with the family downstairs.]
and in doing so,
I desire to retrace the mercies which have
marked my tarriance in it with a grateful spirit;
and whilst I almost tremble at the thought of more intercourse with my fellow creatures,
I would afresh crave preservation from evil;
and truly I have abundant cause to trust under the shadow of His wings,
which has been a shelter to me, many, many times, from the enemy.

15th.--This morning I have craved the best good of my dear father; and for myself,
the continued extension of divine regard.
Poor indeed are my best petitions; but how sweet is the knowledge,
that the prayer of the destitute will not be despised,
if offered in the name of the great Intercessor.

19th.--Truly did I know this morning,
a "`wrestling in prayer,`" on behalf of my own soul, and many, many loved ones.
For the younger members of our meeting, my soul was bowed in fervent supplication.
I feel their wants,
and would ask their supply from the "`Father of mercies,`" for
I am indeed sensible that vain is the help of man,
unless, in unmerited mercy, He is graciously pleased to bless us!

23rd.--Came downstairs to breakfast.
How do I desire that my increased strength may all be devoted
to the best of causes--that my continual inquiry may be,
"`Lord, what wouldst thou have me to do?`"

12mo. 8th.--This is the second anniversary of the day on which
my most precious friend crossed the narrow stream which
separates this "`land of shadows`" from the heavenly Canaan,
and entered, I doubt not, on the full fruition of bliss.
The contemplation of her being a blessed partaker of the "`weight of
glory`" reserved for the ransomed and redeemed of the Lord,
has been, and is, unspeakably consoling; and I feel not the bitterness,
though I still feel the sorrow,
which was my portion immediately after her purified
spirit was released from the shackles of mortality!
Dearly loved Sarah! how should I have prized thy sweet, unfailing sympathy,
in the hours of trial and suffering which have been mine--how
much mightest thou have helped and comforted me!
But I rejoice for thee;
I do confidingly rejoice on thy account--no billow of affliction can any
more assail thee! and whilst still tossed on the waves of the sea of life,
I desire often to be animated to look continually to that heavenly
Pilot who now shelters my dearest friend from every storm;
who has, I rejoicingly trust,
made her a partaker of the riches of His glory--a happy
witness of the brightness of the perfect day!
And now I know it to be my duty, and oh may it be felt also to be my high privilege,
to follow "`the Lamb whithersoever He leadeth,`" not looking to,
or in any way leaning on the arm of any fellow traveller,
but placing my whole confidence in Him.
That this may be my experience, even should it be necessary for me, yet again and again,
to be placed in the furnace, I most ardently long.
I humbly, fervently ask it, in the name,
and for the sake of Him who ever liveth to make intercession
for those who seek to know and do His will--"`Quicken thou me,
according to thy word.`"

17th.--The last few days have been days of much outward occupation;
yet my heart has often been raised during them in fervent longing for,
in ardent thirst after, the water of life.
I have indeed felt, that this alone can satisfy me, and as I write,
I would afresh crave that it may be abundantly granted.

22nd.--My spirit has lately been oppressed, and, at times, truly may I say exercised,
on behalf of one who is bound to me by the closest natural ties.
Thou, O my gracious heavenly Father,
alone knowest the bonds by which he is bound to earth--thou, and thou alone,
canst break those bonds,
and create him anew in Christ Jesus--for His sake I
would crave this fresh manifestation of thy power.
For His sake I would humbly ask thee to show me
all thou wouldst have me to do in this work,
during the accomplishment of which my soul must praise thee,
whether it be in any way through my means or not.
Oh I long to know more of the fulness there is in Jesus,
to have more of the precious influence of His Spirit in my soul.
I have of late been strengthened to commit my body, without fear, to His keeping;
and I have desired, also, fully to commit my soul,
but I want more constant fervency of spirit.

+++[+++Shortly after writing this, her health again failed her,
and she became so weak as to be confined to her room.
Although her complaint had at first exhibited threatening symptoms of consumption,
and awakened feelings of deep anxiety in the
minds of those to whom she was so justly dear,
yet the favourable opinion given by her medical attendants,
and the benefit she derived by the means suggested by them for her relief,
greatly lessened their apprehensions,
and led them to cherish sanguine hopes of her ultimate recovery.
These were strengthened by her continuing to gain ground during the winter;
but their fallacious character became evident towards the beginning of 2nd month,
when the apprehensions of her medical friend
were excited by symptoms of increased disease;
and a subsequent consultation with the physician confirmed his fears,
that the complaint had changed its character, and attacked the lungs.
Her last memorandum in her journal was on the 21st of 2mo. 1838.]

'''

2mo. 21st.--The time which has passed away since I last wrote
any thing here has been memorable in my experience.
My body has again been brought very low, but I have been most tenderly dealt with.
Last night was a restless one,
but I was unspeakably happy--no cloud appeared to darken the future,
and I was strengthened to feel entire resignation to the divine will.

[.small-break]

+++[+++During the few remaining months of her life it was the mournful,
but prized privilege of those of her family who were able to be much with her,
to witness many deeply instructive scenes,
whilst anxiously watching the gradual progress of her fatal disease.
A few of these are here inserted,
evidencing the state of her mind on the near approach of the solemn close;
her anxious solicitude for the spiritual and temporal welfare of those dear to her,
(for she at times entered with deep interest into plans for their
smallest comforts;) and will manifest the power of living "`faith`"
to rob death of its sting--to deprive the grave of its victory.

On her mother`'s informing her, at her own particular request,
of the unfavourable opinion the doctor had of her case,
and seeing her beloved parent much agitated, she sweetly said,
"`My dear mother must not be too much discouraged,
I think it probable I may yet recover.`"
Her mother replying, "`Thee would not wish it, dear,`" she said, "`Yes,
for your sakes;`" and continued cheerfully endeavouring to comfort those around her,
assuring them of her desire to use every means to promote her recovery,
and reminding them that she had several times been brought very low, and raised up again,
contrary to all expectation.
She soon, however, became more sensible of her real situation,
and that the shades of the evening were indeed closing around her:
and though she felt that the summons to her to put off mortality would be a joyful sound,
yet she did most tenderly enter into the feelings of those who tremblingly
anticipated the loosening of the cords which bound her so closely to them;
and often, in times of severest suffering,
would she strive to extend a word of comfort and encouragement.
And when she could no longer do this,
as related to her bodily state--when the fact became too
evident for any around her to disguise it from themselves,
that the hour was very nearly and rapidly approaching,
when the veil which separated her from the unseen world, would be withdrawn,
and she be seen of us no more--then would she endeavour to
convince us that her pains were not so great as they appeared;
and even when it seemed to those who watched her dying pillow,
that the spirit was indeed departing, she would sweetly smile upon them all,
and evidence to any who might have felt a dread of the dark river,
that even its waves could be, and were divided,
and the ransomed follower of the Lamb permitted to pass over dry shod.

One evening she said to her mother,
"`Do not grieve dear mother! we are both travelling the same way,
and need not consider it as parting; only say, Adieu, and soon we meet again.`"
Her mother expressed a desire for an assurance that she was travelling in the same path,
when Mary Ann exclaimed, "`Oh do not doubt it, it distresses me,
I cannot have any doubt for thee;
and there are seasons when I can confidently hope that we shall all be re-united,
and form one family of love in heaven;
I have earnestly prayed for this for so many years.`"

She endured about six weeks of lingering suffering and increasing
prostration of strength with the sweetest resignation.
Quite unable to stand,
and depending principally upon the care and attention of her family for the
little tender offices of love she had so delighted to perform for others,
it was affecting, but most instructive to witness the manner in which,
as her disease advanced, she, by degrees,
relinquished almost all her habits of independent exertion.
She willingly submitted to the means of relief suggested, however painful or unpleasant,
and her watchful care that nothing should be omitted likely to be beneficial,
might have conveyed to those who knew her not,
the impression of an anxious desire for restoration to health.
But those who knew her well,
and who had long known how gladly she would have welcomed the
command to lay aside the garment of the flesh,
and join the blessed company of the redeemed in her Father`'s house,
might learn a lesson of deep instruction from
this beautiful instance of her capacity to adopt,
with heartfelt sincerity, the language, "`Thy will be done, by life or by death.`"
Had the divine will required a prolonged tarriance in the wilderness of this world,
and her path had been surrounded with multiplied conflicts and difficulties,
this would still, we believe, have been her blessed experience;
though "`Thy will be done`" would, doubtless, in this case,
be accompanied with the humble petition of "`If it be possible,
let this cup pass from me.`"
This trial of her faith was, however, spared her,
though at a later period of her illness,
she resignedly contemplated the probability of lingering many months, if not some years,
in a state of helplessness and suffering;
and as she apprehended uselessness--a dispensation the
most opposed to her natural inclination,
and her habits of unwearied industry and active benevolence,
of any she could have received.
But He, who alone knew how entirely her own will had been subjected to His divine will,
was pleased to accept the willingness of heart, and to excuse the sacrifice.
Her shattered bark had not much longer to contend with
the billows of life`'s tempestuous sea,
but was shortly to be anchored on the everlasting shore.

About the middle of the 3rd month she was so tried with the noise of the city,
that a removal was suggested, as a means of relief, to which she readily assented.
In her directions, and little preparatory arrangements of books, clothes, etc.,
it was very evident that she was contemplating a final farewell to her father`'s house.
In the easy carriage of a friend, she bore the removal better than had been expected;
and for some days after taking possession of the pleasant lodgings at the Hotwells,
she was much relieved,
and appeared really better--so that some of her anxiously-interested
friends ventured again to indulge some glimmerings
of hope that she might yet eventually recover.
Very transient, however, were these cheering rays,
for she soon suffered an accession of fever, cough,
and the more acute symptoms of disease;
making it more than ever apparent that her conflicts and
sufferings were nearly approaching their termination.

About this time, when reclining on a sofa, in the room adjoining her chamber,
her mother sitting beside her, she sweetly addressed her for a considerable time.
Alluding to her dear parent`'s long continued ill health, she said,
"`It once appeared most probable that I should have had to take thy place, dear mother,
in our family, but now thou wilt be left to lead forward the little ones.`"
Her mother replied, "`I wish I was as well qualified to guide them.`"
"`Don`'t say so,`" she added, "`thou hast the same source to apply to,
and I believe my sisters will be great comforts and assistants to thee.
I have lively hopes for them all; and for dear +++_______+++ I have no fears.
I wish I could have seen +++_______+++ and +++_______+++
more decidedly making progress in religion.
Oh I do earnestly trust you will all follow me,
that I may be permitted to welcome one after another to Canaan`'s happy shore.`"
Her mother said, "`I have felt comforted, in the belief that thou wilt be permitted,
when taken from us, to watch over us for good.`"
She replied, "`I hope and believe I shall,
and that my removal from you may bring you nearer to Jesus,
and that we may all meet again.`"
Her mother said, "`What a favour it is that thou hast only outward conflict,
for thy mind is preserved in sweet peace.`"
"`It is indeed a mercy,`" she replied, "`for I can do so little now,
I sometimes almost fear my calmness is like indifference,
and that I do not sufficiently feel my many deficiencies.`"

At the same time she entreated her mother not to
entertain discouraging views of her own state,
adding, "`Think more of Jesus and His all-sufficient power.
Many suffer loss, I am convinced, by endeavouring to seek out their states,
whose daily walk is in conformity to the divine
will as far as it has been manifested to them.`"
One evening, when those around her were mourning over her harassing, restless nights,
"`When I am gone,`" she said, with a smile,
"`and you think of my many nights of suffering,
you must remember the perfect rest I shall then be enjoying.
I shall be

Her disease, at this time, appeared to be making such rapid progress,
that she wished to have her four absent brothers sent for,
and on the 1st of the fourth month, the two eldest came from Manchester.
On Charles`'s entering the room,
he was much struck with the dear sufferer`'s emaciated state,
and for a time overcome by his feelings.
She strove to comfort him, saying, "`Don`'t, don`'t grieve; oh I want to see thee smile.
We have been a united family on earth,
oh may we be a united family in heaven--not one missing.

"`Oh it will be joyful-joyful--JOYFUL!

"`I have for so many years earnestly and fervently
prayed that we all may be reunited in glory,
that I have faith to believe it will be so.
Don`'t, don`'t grieve,`" she continued, "`thou must look upon me as not lost,
only gone a little before you.`"
When Henry entered the room she said, "`Well, dear Henry, I seem once more very,
very near home.`"

4mo. 2nd.--Speaking to her brother today,
she alluded to a conversation which had passed between them many months before,
when she was in perfect health, in the course of which she had said,
that if it were right to wish any thing of the sort,
she thought she should desire to be taken off by consumption, and I now, she remarked,
"`my wish seems likely to be granted.`"
"`Too likely,`" said her brother.
But instantly checking him, she quickly said, "`Oh no, no! not too likely.`"
She said, "`When I am suffering from my extreme exhaustion and weakness,
I can indeed feel that vain is the help of man.
My poor bark has been often, often shattered, has it not?`"

3rd.--Another very suffering night has been the portion of this beloved sufferer,
and this morning she said, she felt "`very weak, and very near home.`"
To her brother she said, "`Oh think, dear Charles, how short may be our separation;
how short a time before we may be reunited in glory! oh,
such a reunion! no suffering body there!
You know well where all my hopes are fixed; you know that I do not, in any way,
depend on any works of my own.
I have sometimes thought, that a stranger might mistake my feelings,
from my not saying much; but it is not necessary to say much,
when you so well know what I feel.`"

4th.--Her brother Charles took his leave of her, to go to Manchester.
On leaving the room, he inquired if she had any messages, of which he could be the bearer.
She replied, "`Thou mayest give my dear love to all who kindly inquire for me,
and tell them that I am waiting my appointed time--yes,
whether that appointed time be hours, or days, or weeks, or months, or years.`"

About this time speaking to her mother, she said,
"`Thou hast known how much I have desired and needed best support,
patiently to bear my sufferings, at times when I have felt scarcely able to pray for it.
But in trying to do so in the night, after remembering all my friends,
I was sweetly comforted by what seemed too clear and distinct for a dream.
I thought I saw a number of persons,
whose countenances betokened perfect happiness--they smiled upon me,
and said they were praying for me.
At first, I thought they were the Christians on earth,
but I was afterwards made sensible that they were some of the
blest inhabitants of Zion.--And oh I do rejoice in believing,
that when permitted to join their happy band,
I may thus be engaged on behalf of the many loved ones
I must leave behind me in the wilderness.`"
Her mind seemed clothed with thankfulness, and she frequently expressed,
in glowing terms, her gratitude for the little kindnesses of those around her;
once saying, "`Oh may you have your every want supplied, as mine have been,
when you may need the care I have so abundantly experienced.`"
After a day of much suffering, proceeding from acute pain in the side, she said,
with much emphasis,

"`Oh how delightful rest will be after this;
but I do not think I desire even rest so much as to be where I shall

I endeavour to fix my mind in prayer.
Oh to be where I shall never, never sin! and if we all meet there, how happy shall we be!
You, my dear parents, will be able to say, '`Here are we, Lord,
and the children thou hast given us.`'
It is not wrong, is it, to long to be where there will be no more sin?
You know it does not proceed from any want of affection.`"

About this time, she told her sister, it had been for many months her practice,
before settling to rest for the night, to remember all her friends by name,
in desiring their best welfare; and when prevented, by increasing weakness,
from doing this, she mentioned the places of their residence; but now, she said,
"`even this is too much for me.
Oh, when feeling too weak and exhausted even to think,
I cannot tell thee with what delight I dwell on the words,
"`Resting in Jesus--In the arms of Jesus.`"
She then asked for the hymn,
"`Ah I shall soon be dying,`" the repeating of which she seemed to enjoy.
On one occasion she said,
"`I sometimes think I do not say as much about the ground of my hope as some would wish,
but you know what this has long been.
There is but one way whereby a sinner can be saved.`"

Soon after this she expressed her regret at being able to say so
little about that Saviour who had done such great things for her.
Her mother remarked,
that her illness had been attended with such
severe suffering as prevented much expression.
"`Oh, do not think of the suffering,`" she replied.
"`We, some of us,`" said her mother, "`painfully fear,
that it is on account of some of us such a dispensation is allotted thee.`"
"`Then,`" she sweetly rejoined, "`if that be the case,
it must be designed for the good of some one; and for such a purpose,
I should consider it a privilege to suffer.`"

In the evening of this day a very violent pain in the
side was accompanied by such a struggle to expectorate,
as to threaten suffocation.
Every attempt at giving her ease proved ineffectual,
until the middle of the second night, when the symptoms became suddenly much alleviated.
A beloved friend, who saw her during this season of extreme suffering,
was unable to restrain her tears, when the patient sufferer attempted to smile,
and whispered, "`Do not grieve for me, it is only the poor body.`"
Her mother said, "`The mind is all peace.`"
"`Yes, she replied, "`kept in sweet peace--what a mercy!`"
A few days after this, her mother, sitting in the room writing,
observed a most sweet and animated expression brightening her pallid countenance.
She shortly after said, "`Oh I have been so very happy--so brightly happy!
I never before so fully realized the near prospect of
perfect and eternal rest throughout my illness;
the words have indeed been applicable to me, "`Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace,
whose mind is stayed on thee.`"
In the afternoon she told her mother, she had been earnestly desiring,
if consistent with the divine will,
that she might have a little respite from pain before she was taken from us;
and the following morning, on her beloved parent entering her room, she exclaimed,
with a sweet smile, "`Oh I have had such nice sleep!`"
And for three successive days and nights her supplication was remarkably answered.
During this time of comparative freedom from suffering,
she was able to make many arrangements for the future,
give directions respecting the disposal of her books after her decease,
and write in many of them a short and emphatic message.

To the very last she would enter, with unabated interest,
into the domestic arrangements of her family,
and talked of plans for the promotion of their comfort.
"`When I am gone,`" she would say, with an animated smile,
"`you will be able to adopt such and such a plan.
I often believe, that, though unseen, I shall be very near you.
Do, do, all follow me to my happy home.
Oh think what a delightful exchange from this state of
pain and weariness for one of perfect rest!`"
After a night of extreme suffering, she said, "`I have prayed,
that if it be needful for me, I may be taken as to the garden of Gethsemane,
and may remain there as long as is best for me--treading in
every step in which the great Captain of my salvation has trod,
if I may but be made perfect through suffering.`"
Then, alluding to her great drowsiness, she said, "`I am afraid I am like the disciples,
not willing to watch.`"
Looking up tenderly in her mother`'s face, she said,
"`How many hours hast thou watched over me, dear mother!
I fear I shall weary you all out.`"

Towards the end of the 4th month, her little remaining strength declined so rapidly,
that her brother Charles was again hastily sent for.
Before he arrived she had a most severe attack of pain in her side,
for which blisters were repeatedly applied.
Though very patient, the expression of her countenance evinced extreme suffering,
but she endeavoured to smile, and assured those around her, it was only the poor body.
"`When I am going,`" she said, "`if I am not able to speak, and appear to be suffering,
you will know that it is only the poor body;`" adding,
"`If Jesus had not been my all in all, how could I bear this?`"
Seeing her mother much distress, with a look of tender love, she said, "`My dear,
dear mother! when I am gone, thou wilt have a better Comforter.
You all know the ground of my hope,
though I have not said much on the subject--there is but one way to be saved.
Jesus is the only Saviour.`"
Her sister S+++______+++ sitting beside her bed, she remarked,
how near the close she seemed to be in the morning, and said,
"`What a comfort it was to feel so calm as I did at such a time;`" adding,
"`and now I am so happy.
G+++.+++ F+++______+++ (the surgeon) thinks it cannot last long.`"
After a short silence, she said,
"`Thou must give my very dear love to the dear children at Leominster, and tell them,
I hope they will remember all I have said to them of their highest duties.`"

The next morning, after some quiet sleep, she woke with the impression,
that she could scarcely survive the day.
Increased difficulty of breathing, and partial suspension of the action of the heart,
caused our medical friend to confirm our apprehensions
that a few hours would terminate her sufferings.
She heard the opinion, and contemplated the solemn prospect with serenity and joyful hope.
She requested that the whole family then in Bristol might be assembled,
took a tender leave of her younger sisters and brother and little nephew,
adding a few words of affection to them, and told them she was very happy.
She then took an impressive leave of the servants.
The remainder of the family, and a truly kind aunt, remained with her.

Much of what passed during this memorable day cannot be accurately remembered,
the intense interest of the scene preventing taking any notes at the time.
"`If this be dying,`" she said, "`it is not hard to die.
I am in no pain.`"
Her mother said, "`Thou art going to Jerusalem, thy happy home, love.`"
"`Yes,`" she exclaimed, "`my bright, my glorious home.
Oh you must all follow me--don`'t let one be missing.
How delightful it will be to welcome one after another where
there is no more sorrow--no more pain--no more sin!
Don`'t weep for me, dear mother.`"
Her mother said,
"`I can in some degree rejoice with thee in thy prospects of happiness,`"
and reminded her of a dream she had in the early part of her illness,
in which she thought she was standing near the sea shore,
patiently waiting for the wave which was
commissioned to bear her away to her happy home.

All her family seemed around her, but her mother, particularly, was very near her;
and in reply to a question asked by her, which she could not recollect,
the blissful feelings which accompanied her answer--"`Happy,
very happy,`"--were deeply impressed on her mind.`"
"`Perhaps,`" continued her mother,
"`thou wilt be permitted to welcome me to thy happy home, if I dare hope to reach it.`"
She replied, with a bright smile, "`Oh I hope I shall be the very first to welcome thee.`"
She then desired that her very dear love might be given to her absent brothers, and said,
"`Oh I am afraid that dear Charles will be much tried, to find me gone,
but you must comfort him, and tell him there is no cause to grieve for me.`"
Turning to her sisters, she said, "`My dear girls! oh keep very close to Jesus!
He will so tenderly care for you.
He has made my dying bed so soft!`"
This never to be forgotten season, was on a first day;
and alluding to her having always enjoyed the day of rest, she said,
"`but this is the happiest of all.`"

The alarming symptoms which seemed to threaten dissolution continued unabated,
but the beloved patient repeatedly assured those around her,
that she was not suffering--that she was "`most tenderly dealt with`"--and repeated,
in a low voice, but very distinctly, the lines,

[verse]
____
"`Oh glorious hour! oh blest abode!
I shall be near and like my God!
And sin and sense no more control,
The sacred pleasures of my soul.`"
____

She spoke of the fine day, and said,
"`But oh it is nothing to the brightness of the land where I am going.`"
She more than once bade all about her an impressive farewell;
and they waited in solemn expectation of witnessing the release of
the redeemed spirit from its frail and suffering tenement;
and listening, with eager attention,
to the words she was able from time to time to utter,
expressive of the glorious anticipation she was permitted to enjoy,
and abundantly evidencing, that in approaching her, Death had laid aside his terrors.

Contrary to all expectation, towards evening the difficulty of breathing subsided;
and when the surgeon called he found her much relieved,
though he expressed his opinion that she could scarcely survive another day.
During the night she had some sleep, and she was, though very faint, free from spasm.
In the afternoon the affection of the heart returned with such
violence as to make us almost momentarily anticipate her dissolution.

At this time she repeatedly said, "`Oh keep close to the Saviour!
Do endeavour to follow me!
Christ is all to me now--oh make Him your friend!`"
Her remarkable self-possession was, at this solemn moment, strikingly evinced.
Having closed her eyes, as she believed forever, on earthly things,
she whispered to her sister, "`Don`'t be alarmed when my head drops.`"
When, however, all about her thought she had indeed ceased to breathe,
a sudden reaction of the vital powers caused her regretfully, but patiently, to exclaim,
"`Oh I`'m coming back again!`"
And again she revived, to the astonishment of all.

Early on the following morning, 5mo. 1st, her brother Charles again arrived,
and she bore her interview with him better than had been feared.
Upon entering the room and sitting beside her,
she sweetly endeavoured to hand him words of consolation.
"`Don`'t, oh don`'t grieve,`" she said, "`oh think how short a separation ours may be;
I shall not be lost, thou knows, but gone a little before you.
Oh I cannot bear to see thee grieve.`"
And again, "`Thou knows, dear, how I have dreaded sinning; oh think how joyful to be,
where there is no more temptation.
I shall see His face, and never, never sin.
Oh it seems to me that the absence of all sin would, of itself,
make heaven a very bright and a very glorious place.

Writing to an absent brother, Charles asked if he should give him any message from her.
"`Give him my dearest love,`" she said, "`tell him that I am happy, very happy,
and that I desire when he comes to a death bed,
he may experience the same support which I now feel.`"
Her brother Charles, on leaving her again at this time,
had a deeply interesting interview with her, during which, she said,
"`When thou art gone, dear, do not think of me as I am now,
do not think of the poor suffering body;
but oh think of me as a joyful partaker of the "`grace of life,`" though very unworthy.`"
On his enquiring if he could do any thing for her, she replied, "`No, dear,
except to desire, that patience may hold out to the end.
When I am gone, dear Charles, thou wilt have one tie less to earth,
and one tie more to heaven!
Oh press forwards! oh look upwards!
Count nothing too small a trial to bring to thy Saviour;
but oh simply and constantly look unto Him; and do not think of me as I am now,
but as I soon shall be.`"
On his leaving the room, she said,

[verse]
____
"`Go! and my spirit goes with thee,
Go! and thy spirit stays with me.`"
____

Shortly after this she experienced another of her most distressing attacks
of difficulty of breathing--the windows and door were thrown open,
to comply with her gasping request for "`more air.`"
She appeared in extreme suffering, but on her sister bending over her,
and expressing a hope that her pain was not very great, she replied,
"`Oh....no....dear I am very happy "`tis.... very easy, if.... this is death.`"
For nearly six weeks from this time she remained
in a state of great weakness and langour,
often attended with much bodily suffering; but peace, sweet, heavenly peace,
seemed to cover her to the end as a mantle.
Frequent distressing attacks of difficulty of breathing,
seemed to convince us of how very,
very slight and uncertain a hold we had on our beloved one.
But her appetite during this time improved, and she evidently gained strength.
Wonderful were the dealings of the Most High towards her, and we had, indeed, to learn,
that His way is in the sea, and His paths in the mighty waters,
and His footsteps unknown.
But while some of us might be ready to query, why is it thus?
from a feeling of tender sympathy with the beloved departing one,
again and again brought back, as it were, from the portals of the heavenly city,
when the dark valley appeared to have been trodden,
and the waves of Jordan to have been divided before her,
the answer seemed evidently to be, "`That I may show forth my power in my servant,
and cause her to glorify me, even as in the fires.`"
And truly not a few of those who stood beside that dying pillow, retired therefrom,
with hearts full of wondering praise, at having witnessed such a display of divine power,
in enabling the mind of a suffering disciple so to
triumph over the pain and weakness of the body.
Much might be said of this time,
during which not a murmur or sign of impatience escaped the precious sufferer.
But we hasten to the closing scene, in which, indeed, those who witnessed it,
could rejoicingly testify,
that He who had been her morning light became her evening song.

On second day morning, the 11th of 6mo., after a comparatively easy night, she entered,
in an animated manner, into conversation with her beloved mother, on various subjects,
and seemed more free from pain,
and more able to converse than had been for some time the case.
Towards noon, however, she hastily called her mother to her bedside, and,
looking earnestly at her, said, "`Mother, I`'m either very faint,
or I`'m going--Am I going?`"
A little wine was given her, of which she partook eagerly a few tea-spoonsful,
but finding it did not revive her, she repeated the enquiry, "`Am I faint,
or am I going?`"
A change came over her countenance, and a cold perspiration covered it.
Her mother said, "`My love, if thou art going thou art quite ready.`"
"`Oh yes!`" she replied, in strong and joyful accents, "`quite, quite ready,
and I do believe I am going to my happy, my heavenly home!
Let me kiss you.`"
She did so tenderly, and said, "`Farewell! dearest love to all.`"
To the servant she said, "`Eliza, I am going home,
to my heavenly home!`" and repeated her message of dearest love to all.
Her sister again offered her wine, but she declined it, saying, "`No more, thank thee,
dear.... I am....going....going.... home.`"
"`Oh,`" said her mother,
"`I do hope nothing has been omitted or neglected that could be done for her.`"
"`Oh no,`" she exclaimed, with earnestness, "`everything has been done,
but now I am going.... I am going....to my happy home.`"
Her mother leaned over her, and repeated, in a whisper, some favourite lines of a hymn,

[verse]
____
"`One gentle sigh, her fetters breaks,
We scarce can say, she`'s gone,
Before the willing spirit takes
Its mansion near the throne.`"
____

She gave a bright smile of intelligence, but did not speak.
Her mother then said, "`Thy Saviour is with thee, dear, in the dark valley.`"
She emphatically, but with difficulty, replied,
"`Oh yes!`" It was then asked if she was in suffering.
With considerable effort, but very distinctly, she replied,
"`Oh no....no so very.... VERY.... happy!
These were the last intelligible expressions;
but on her beloved mother repeating the words used by a dear friend to his dying brother,
"`Thou art about to stand before the throne,
with palms in thy hands,`" she gently pressed the hands she fondly held in hers,
and sweetly smiled.
Almost immediately afterwards, her eyes became fixed,
a slight convulsion came on for a few seconds, then one or two long drawn breathings,
a gentle sigh,
and all was over.--A lifeless tenement of clay
was all that remained of our tenderly loved one;
her purified spirit, washed and made white in the "`blood of the Lamb,`" has,
we undoubtingly believe, been permitted to enter, through the pearl gates,
into that glorious city which hath "`no need of the sun, neither of the moon,
to shine in it, for the glory of the Lord doth lighten it,
and the Lamb is the light thereof,`"--has joined
that blissful company which no man can number,
who, with the Father`'s name inscribed upon their foreheads,
are assembled upon Zion`'s hill,
and sing the song of praise and thanksgiving to Him who hath redeemed them.

After her death the following lines, addressed to her relatives, were found,
traced by her trembling hand in pencil.]

[.salutation]
Farewell, my much loved parents, brothers, and sisters!

My heart is full, in the consideration that most probably,
this is the last time I shall address you in this manner.
Very tender and strong have been the ties which have united us,
and my spirit has trembled in the prospect of their being severed; but the precious hope,
that, ere very long, we shall be forever united, has conveyed unspeakable consolation.
May this indeed be our blessed experience!
Oh that every obstacle may be overcome,
and that each may make steady progress in the road to Zion!
How often has my spirit been bowed before the throne on behalf of each!
How fervently do I now crave that you, my beloved parents,
may each be taught and led by the "`Shepherd of Israel!`" shewn by Him your wants,
and strengthened by Him to seek continually a supply of them.
And you, my much loved brothers and sisters, know my most earnest desire for you is,
to make the one great object of your lives, the knowledge of "`Christ,
and Him crucified!`"
Oh let me, once more entreat you to live as strangers and pilgrims here; and to seek,
with increasing earnestness,
a preparation for an enduring inheritance in that happy land, whither, I humbly trust,
through redeeming mercy, I am hastening, and where I confidently hope we may meet again!

The shadows of the evening of my day I watch with grateful joy!
Whilst deeply unworthy, I rest in hope of the glory of God!

[.signed-section-closing]
Most affectionately,

[.signed-section-closing]
Farewell! Farewell.
